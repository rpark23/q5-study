## Learning Objectives

### 1. Recognize Epidemiology and Health Disparities in Epilepsy

**Epidemiology:**
- Epilepsy is the 4th most common neurologic disease
- Affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide
- About 10% of people will have at least one seizure during their lifetime
- Has a bimodal distribution: most common in children under 10 years and adults over 65 years

**Health Disparities:**
- **Global burden:** Poverty is a risk factor for epilepsy. Low-income countries have twice the prevalence and incidence compared to high-income countries
- **Treatment gap:** 10% in high-income countries, 50% in middle-income countries, and 75% in low-income countries don't receive needed treatment
- **US disparities:** Black patients are less likely to receive optimal medications and surgical treatment compared to non-Hispanic whites, even after controlling for socioeconomic status
- **Native Americans:** Least likely racial/ethnic group to receive EEG, longest time to diagnosis (27 months), and lower likelihood of seeing a neurologist
- **LGBTQ+ patients:** No epidemiologic studies exist despite 5.6% of Americans identifying as LGBTQ+

### 2. Define Key Terms: Seizure, Epilepsy

**Seizure:**
- An electrical disturbance in the brain (cortex) from abnormal excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal activity
- Causes neurologic symptoms such as altered consciousness, behavior changes, or sensorimotor dysfunction
- Can be **provoked** (reversible triggers like fever, drugs, metabolic disturbances) or **unprovoked** (spontaneous)

**Epilepsy:**
A disease of the brain defined by ANY of the following:
1. At least 2 unprovoked seizures occurring >24 hours apart
2. One unprovoked seizure + probability of further seizures ≥60% (e.g., one seizure + MRI showing cortical brain tumor)
3. Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome (e.g., absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy)

**Key distinction:** Seizure ≠ Epilepsy. A seizure is a symptom; epilepsy is a disease characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures.

### 3. Describe the Clinical Presentation of Seizures

**Key Features:**
- Seizures are **stereotyped, transient, episodic events** with clear onset and offset
- Duration: seconds to minutes
- Good history makes the diagnosis in 90% of cases

**History should include:**
- What happens before, during, and after the seizure
- Associated symptoms: confusion, loss of consciousness, tongue biting, bladder/bowel incontinence
- Frequency for each seizure type
- Triggers: missed medications, drugs, menses, fever, stress, lack of sleep
- Risk factors: perinatal events, febrile seizures, developmental delay, family history, brain insults

**Physical Examination:**
- Check ABCs and vital signs
- General exam: Look for tongue bites, trauma, stigmata of genetic disease
- Neurologic exam: Assess mental status, look for focal deficits, CNS signs, medication side effects

---

### 4. Apply the 3-Step Approach to Neurologic Diagnosis

**Step 1: Formulate key symptoms + signs → Establish time course**
- Seizures are **episodic** (punched out in time with clear onset/offset)

**Step 2: Anatomical localization → Where is it?**
- Seizures arise from the **cerebral cortex** (not subcortical structures, brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord)
- May further localize/lateralize based on presenting symptoms

**Step 3: Etiological diagnosis → What is it?**
- Use mnemonic "I MIND THE VIP" for differential diagnosis
- Seizure mimickers include TIAs, migraines, psychiatric non-epileptic events
- **Neuroimaging:** MRI brain without contrast (epilepsy protocol) is preferred for evaluating new onset unprovoked seizures

---

### 5. Classify Major Seizure Types: Focal vs. Generalized

**Classification based on mode of onset:**

**FOCAL (Partial) Seizures:**
- Start in one hemisphere/region of the brain
- Produce focal symptoms at seizure onset
- Can be:
  - **Focal preserved consciousness** (simple partial/focal aware): Patient remembers entire episode
  - **Focal impaired consciousness** (complex partial): Altered awareness, consciousness, or memory
- May evolve to **focal to bilateral tonic-clonic** seizures
- Look for: focal symptoms, automatisms (lip smacking, fumbling), aura (déjà vu, epigastric rising, limbic feelings)

**GENERALIZED Seizures:**
- Involve bilateral hemispheres at onset
- Types include:
  - **Absence (petit mal):** Behavioral arrest, staring, eye fluttering; seconds duration; no post-ictal period
  - **Tonic-clonic:** Full body stiffening (tonic) and rhythmic jerking (clonic)
  - **Myoclonic:** Brief, irregular positive increase in tone
  - **Atonic:** Sudden loss of muscle tone (drop attacks)

---

### 6. Recall Common Causes of Seizures

**Etiology Classification:**

**Structural/Metabolic (Symptomatic):**
- Usually focal seizures
- Brain tumor, cortical stroke, trauma, cortical dysplasia
- **Most common cause in adults:** Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS)

**Genetic (Idiopathic):**
- Usually idiopathic primary generalized epilepsies
- Absence (petit mal) epilepsy
- Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)

**Unknown (Cryptogenic):**
- No underlying cause identified (~50% of cases)

**Age-dependent causes:**
- **Neonates:** Birth trauma, stroke, hypoxia, infections, metabolic disorders
- **Children:** Febrile seizures, idiopathic/genetic epilepsies
- **Adolescents/Young adults:** Mesial temporal sclerosis, head trauma, illicit drugs
- **Older adults:** Stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, brain tumors

**Mnemonic "MOVE STUPID":**
- **M**etabolic, **O**xygen, **V**ascular, **E**ndocrine, **S**tructural, **T**oxic/Trauma, **U**remia, **P**sychogenic, **I**nfection/Inflammation/Inherited/Idiopathic, **D**egenerative/Developmental

### 7. Discuss Treatment Options

**Medical Treatment (First-line):**
- Anti-seizure medications (ASMs)
- About 2/3 of patients become seizure-free with medications

**For Drug-Refractory Epilepsy (fails 2 medications at therapeutic doses):**

**Surgical Options:**
- **Open resection:** 58-85% seizure-free for temporal lobe epilepsy
- **Laser ablation:** 62% seizure-free at Stanford (minimally invasive)

**Device Options (Palliative):**
- **VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation):** >50% reduction in seizure frequency in ~50%
- **RNS (Responsive Neural Stimulation):** 18% ≥6 months seizure-free; 75% median seizure reduction at 7 years
- **DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation):** Similar efficacy to RNS

**Key Treatment Principles:**
- Refer to epilepsy specialist if drug-refractory
- Choice of medication based on seizure type, co-morbidities, and side effect profile
- **Ethosuximide:** Narrowest spectrum ASM - only treats absence seizures

---

### 8. Identify Psychosocial Impact

**Co-morbidities:**
- **Depression:** Most common (affects 1 in 10 people with epilepsy)
- Anxiety, post-ictal psychosis, ADHD

**Social Issues:**
- **Driving restrictions:** Must be seizure-free for at least 6 months in California
- Employment discrimination (protected by 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act)
- Lower rates of marriage, problems in school and relationships
- Limitations on sports and recreational activities
- Social stigma similar to HIV/AIDS

**Safety Precautions:**
- Shower safer than bath
- Caution around cutting machinery, open flames, caustic chemicals
- Cook on back burner
- Avoid high-risk activities: mountain climbing, scuba diving, motor sports

## Neuroanatomy Review: Sensorimotor Homunculus

The lecture reviewed the organization of the primary motor and sensory cortices, where different body parts are represented in specific cortical regions. A **Jacksonian march** occurs when a focal seizure spreads along the motor or sensory homunculus, causing sequential involvement of adjacent body parts (e.g., seizure starting in the mouth spreading to the eye).

## Key Clinical Syndromes Covered

### 1. Childhood Absence Epilepsy
- Elementary school-aged children
- Behavioral arrest with staring, subtle eye fluttering
- Sudden onset/offset (seconds), no post-ictal period
- EEG: 3-4 Hz generalized spike-wave discharges
- Treatment: Ethosuximide or broad-spectrum ASM
- Good prognosis: 80% outgrow by age 21

### 2. Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy
- Most common cause of focal impaired consciousness seizures in adults
- Symptoms: Déjà vu, epigastric rising, automatisms, confusion, aphasia if dominant hemisphere
- MRI: Atrophy and bright signal in hippocampus
- Pathology: Neuronal loss and gliosis in hippocampus

## Seizure Mimickers (Differential Diagnosis)

**Found Down:** Syncope, stroke/TIA, metabolic disturbances, head trauma, sleep disorders

**Abnormal Movements:** Movement disorders (tremor, tics, myoclonus, dystonia), reflexive movements, sleep disorders, shivering

**Confused:** Migraine, stroke/TIA, transient global amnesia, encephalopathy/delirium, sleep disorders

**Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Events (PNEE):** Most common seizure mimicker; involuntary episodes due to functional neurologic disorder; diagnosed with video-EEG monitoring

---

## First Aid for Seizures

1. Assess ABCs
2. Turn patient to side to prevent aspiration
3. Cushion head, loosen tight clothing
4. Time the seizure
5. **Do NOT** place anything in mouth or restrain patient
6. If seizure lasts >3-5 minutes, give rescue medication (e.g., 2mg lorazepam) and call 911
7. **Status epilepticus** (continuous seizure ≥5 minutes) is a medical emergency

## Take Home Points

- Epilepsy is common (1% of population)
- Know how seizures present: stereotyped, episodic events with clear onset/offset
- Classify seizures as focal vs. generalized
- Look for etiologies with brain MRI
- Beware seizure imitators (syncope, psychogenic events, etc.)
- Medications are first-line therapy; ~2/3 become seizure-free
- Fail two drugs → refer to Epilepsy Center for surgery or devices
- Address psychosocial and co-morbid issues, especially depression
