## Learning Objectives

### 1. Basic Gross Anatomy and Histology of the Nervous System

The nervous system is organized into distinct anatomical compartments with specific pathological vulnerabilities:

**Brain Compartments:**
- Supratentorial region
- Infratentorial region (brainstem and cerebellum)
- Sellar/suprasellar region
- Pineal region
- Ventricular system
- Coverings (dura and bone)
- Spinal cord and cauda equina

**Key Anatomical Principle: The Brain Lives in a Closed Box**
- Intracranial contents = Brain tissue + CSF + Blood
- Adding mass lesions increases intracranial pressure
- Pressure compromises: (1) CSF/ventricles, (2) blood flow, (3) brain tissue
- Asymmetric swelling leads to herniations
- Tonsillar herniation is the only lethal form, compressing respiratory centers in the medulla
- Lumbar punctures must be avoided when risk of tonsillar herniation exists

**Gray vs. White Matter:**
- Gray matter contains neuronal cell bodies, abundant neuropil, and has higher metabolic demands
- White matter consists primarily of myelinated axons and glial cells
- These regions show different disease susceptibilities (selective vulnerability)

### 2. Selective Vulnerability - The Central Concept in Neuropathology

Selective vulnerability is the principle that different brain regions, cell types, and developmental stages show varying susceptibility to injury. This concept appears at both gross and microscopic levels.

**Factors Influencing Selective Vulnerability:**
- Age and stage of neurodevelopment
- Blood supply and vascular anatomy
- Genetic factors (germline and somatic)
- Nutritional status
- Toxins and metabolic injury (including hypoxia-ischemia)
- Trauma

**Examples of Selective Vulnerability in Gray Matter:**
- Most neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer disease)
- Hypoxia-ischemia and stroke
- Neuronal storage disorders (Tay-Sachs disease)
- Some infections (Herpes encephalitis, West Nile virus)
- Toxins (ethanol causes cerebellar vermis degeneration; methanol affects basal ganglia)
- Epilepsy
- Some tumors (ganglioglioma)

**Examples of Selective Vulnerability in White Matter:**
- Demyelinating diseases (autoimmune or toxic)
- Radiation injury
- Some infections (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy from JC virus)
- Microvascular and microembolic disorders (malaria, carbon monoxide poisoning)
- Leukodystrophies from inborn errors (Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy)

**Hierarchical Vulnerability to Hypoxia-Ischemia (decreasing order):**
1. Hippocampus (CA1/Sommer's sector)
2. Cerebral cortex (layers III and V)
3. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
4. Thalamus
5. Basal ganglia
6. Brain stem
7. Hypothalamus
8. Spinal cord

Note: Pattern differs significantly in young infants

**Clinical Correlation:** The neuropathology correlates with clinical and radiological findings because neurological symptoms reflect the specific brain regions affected.

### 3. Stains and Immunohistochemistry in Neuropathology

**Routine Stains:**
- Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) - standard histological stain
- Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) - stains myelin blue, essential for detecting demyelination

**Silver Stains:**
- Detect neurofilaments which are "silver-loving" (argyrophilic)
- Used to visualize neuronal processes and axons
- Historically important for identifying neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease

**Key Immunohistochemical Markers:**
- **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)** - identifies astrocytes and reactive gliosis
- **Neurofilament antibodies** - highlight neuronal cytoskeleton and axons
- **Synaptophysin** - marks presynaptic vesicle proteins
- **Beta-APP (Beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein)** - highly sensitive marker for acute axonal injury (upregulated immediately after trauma)
- **CD68** - identifies microglia/macrophages

### 4. Basic Pathological Alterations in Neurons

**Hypoxic-Ischemic Change ("Red Dead Neurons"):**
- Earliest morphologic marker of neuronal death
- Appears 6-12 hours after irreversible injury
- Features: cell shrinkage, nuclear pyknosis, loss of nucleolus, loss of Nissl substance, intense cytoplasmic eosinophilia
- Classic location: CA1 region of hippocampus in global hypoxia-ischemia

**Chromatolysis:**
- Observed during axonal regeneration
- Best seen in spinal cord anterior horn cells after motor axon damage
- Features: cell body enlargement and rounding, peripheral nuclear displacement, enlarged nucleolus, dispersed Nissl substance
- Reflects increased protein synthesis for axon repair

**Mineralization (Ferrugination):**
- Seen in neonatal/premature brain after hypoxic-ischemic injury
- Dead neurons replaced by mineralized "fossils" that stain purple

**Neuronophagia:**
- Engulfment of dead/dying neurons by microglia
- Classic finding in viral encephalitis but also nonspecific
- Residual microglial nodules are common in viral infections

**Aging Changes:**
- **Lipofuscin** - "wear and tear" pigment, normal age-related finding in many neurons
- **Neuromelanin** - found in substantia nigra neurons (distinct from skin melanin)

**Neuronal Inclusions:**
- **Neurodegenerative diseases:**
  - Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease
  - Neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease
- **Viral inclusions:**
  - Cowdry type A bodies (CMV, Herpes, SSPE)
  - Negri bodies (rabies)

**Axonal Pathology:**
- **Axonal spheroids** - result from shearing injury in traumatic brain injury
- Form like "water balloons" from continued axoplasmic flow into sealed axons
- Beta-APP immunostaining is highly sensitive for detecting diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
- DAI can cause immediate unconsciousness without mass lesion or skull fracture

**Storage Disorders:**
- Distended neuronal cell bodies with displaced nucleus
- Swollen neuritic processes (meganeurites)
- Seen in various inborn errors of metabolism

### 5. Basic Pathological Alterations in Glial Cells

**Astrocytes (Most Common CNS Cell Type):**

*Functions:*
- Constitute 20-50% of brain volume
- Embryonic guidance of migrating neurons (radial glial cells)
- Source of neuronal growth factors
- Partition brain and ensheath synapses
- Induce blood-brain barrier properties in endothelial cells
- Promote angiogenesis
- Neurotransmitter uptake and inactivation (especially glutamate)
- Buffer extracellular space
- React to injury (gliosis)

*Pathological Changes:*
- **Reactive gliosis** - response to virtually all CNS injuries, analogous to fibrosis
- Enlarged cell bodies with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm
- Nuclear displacement
- Upregulation of GFAP expression
- Can be extensive enough to prevent functional recovery

*Special Types:*
- **Alzheimer type II astrocytes** - seen in hepatic encephalopathy with hyperammonemia
- **Bergmann astrocytes** - specialized cerebellar astrocytes
- **Radial glia** - guide neuronal migration during development

*Neoplastic:*
- Astrocytomas are tumors showing features reminiscent of astrocytes

**Oligodendrocytes:**

*Functions:*
- Produce myelin in CNS (analogous to Schwann cells in PNS)
- Single oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons
- Among most vulnerable cells to CNS injury

*Histological Features:*
- Small cell bodies with few short processes
- "Fried egg" appearance in formalin-fixed tissue (perinuclear halo artifact)

*Pathology:*
- Loss causes demyelination affecting multiple axons
- Target cells in:
  - Multiple sclerosis (autoimmune demyelination)
  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (JC virus infection)
  - Leukodystrophies (Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy)

*Neoplastic:*
- Oligodendrogliomas show monotonous "fried egg" cells

**Ependymal Cells:**
- Line ventricular system
- Ciliated cells that help move CSF
- Establish CSF-brain barrier
- Rich in aquaporin-4 water channels
- Vulnerable to viral infections at CSF-brain interface
- Source of ependymomas (tumors)

**Microglia (CNS Tissue Macrophages):**

*Origin and Function:*
- Derived from blood monocytes during embryonic development
- Represent resting/uncommitted myeloid progenitors in normal brain
- Share markers with monocytes/macrophages (CD68)
- Involved in immune surveillance and inflammatory responses

*Pathological Roles:*
- Participate in neuronophagia
- Form microglial nodules in viral encephalitis
- Major HIV reservoir in CNS
- May contribute to progression of Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative conditions
- Can have both destructive and trophic functions

**Radiation Injury:**
- Primarily affects white matter (counterintuitively)
- Myelin turnover (~88 days) predisposes to injury
- Can cause large areas of coagulative necrosis
- May lead to secondary tumor formation (sarcomas, gliomas, meningiomas)

**Krabbe Leukodystrophy:**
- Deficiency of galactosylceramidase
- Toxic galactosylsphingosine accumulation
- Rapidly progressive in infants (onset 3-6 months, death by 2 years)
- Shrunken, firm white matter with spared cortex
- Globoid cells (engorged macrophages) characteristic
- Potential treatment: cord blood transplantation if pre-symptomatic

## Take-Home Points

1. Neurons and glia display a range of functional and morphologic changes following injury that reflect the mechanism and type of neurological disease

2. Understanding pathological patterns provides information about disease mechanisms and helps correlate with clinical findings

3. Because brain functions are anatomically compartmentalized, clinical symptoms depend as much on the affected brain region as on the pathologic process

4. Mature neurons cannot divide, so destruction of even small numbers of functionally critical neurons produces neurologic deficits

5. Selective vulnerability is the fundamental organizing principle in neuropathology - always ask what form of selective vulnerability is demonstrated in any neurological disease

6. The neuropathology roadmap distinguishes CNS from PNS diseases, with different pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations

7. Multiple diagnostic modalities (gross examination, histology, special stains, immunohistochemistry) are essential for accurate neuropathological diagnosis
