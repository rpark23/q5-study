## The 3-Step Approach to Neurologic Diagnosis

This systematic approach allows neurologists to establish a diagnosis 90% of the time.

### Step 1: History and Physical Examination (H&P)

**Establish the time course** of neurologic symptoms, which provides critical clues to the underlying pathophysiological mechanism:

- **Acute (seconds-minutes):** Stroke, hemorrhage, trauma
- **Progressive, chronic (months-years):** Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's)
- **Subacute (days-weeks):** Infection, subdural hematoma, fast-growing tumor
- **Waxing and waning (days-weeks):** Inflammatory or demyelinating diseases (multiple sclerosis)
- **Episodic (minutes-hours):** Transient ischemic attack (TIA), seizure, migraine

Ask precise questions: What were you doing at the time? What happened before, during, and after? What symptoms occurred first, then next? How did symptoms progress?

### Step 2: Localize the Lesion Anatomically

**Localize on the Y-axis:** Determine if the lesion is in the CNS or PNS, then specify the subsection.

**CNS subdivisions:**
- Cortex (gray matter)
- Subcortical fibers (white matter)
- Basal ganglia
- Brainstem
- Cerebellum
- Spinal cord

**PNS subdivisions:**
- Dorsal root ganglia
- Anterior horn cells (motor neurons)
- Nerve roots
- Plexus
- Peripheral nerves
- Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
- Muscle

**Localize on the X-axis:** Does it lateralize to the right, left, or midline? Is it diffuse, symmetric, or asymmetric?

**Apply Occam's Razor:** Select the simplest localization that explains the features. If symptoms cannot be explained by one location, consider multifocal or systemic processes.

### Step 3: Formulate Diagnosis (Dx) and Differential Diagnosis (DDx)

Use the mnemonic **"I MIND THE VIP"** to systematically consider broad categories:
- **I** - Infectious
- **M** - Metabolic
- **I** - Iatrogenic
- **N** - Neoplastic
- **D** - Degenerative, Developmental, Demyelinating
- **T** - Trauma, Toxic
- **H** - Hereditary
- **E** - Endocrine, Epileptic
- **V** - Vascular
- **I** - Inflammatory
- **P** - Psychiatric

After localization and DDx, pursue informed diagnostic testing (imaging, EEG, CSF analysis, labs, EMG/NCS, genetics, pathology) to confirm clinical suspicions.

## CNS Patterns for Localization

### Cortical Signs (The "A's")

Lesions in the cerebral cortex produce eloquent deficits:

- **Aphasia:** Language deficit (Broca's = expressive, non-fluent; Wernicke's = receptive, fluent)
- **Anopsia:** Visual field deficit (e.g., hemianopsia)
- **Agnosia:** Neglect of contralateral universe, unaware of deficit (anosognosia)
- **Apraxia:** Inability to follow motor commands despite intact comprehension and motor function
- **Amnesia:** Memory disturbance
- Additional: Alexia, Agraphia, Acalculia, Agraphesthesia, Astereognosia

### Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) Lesions

Injury to the corticospinal tract (CST) produces contralateral deficits:

- **Hyperreflexia (4+):** Pathologically increased reflexes
  - Babinski sign (extensor plantar response)
  - Sustained clonus
  - Frontal release signs (in dementia/frontal disorders)
- **Spasticity:** Velocity-dependent increased tone ("clasp-knife" phenomenon)
- **Pyramidal pattern of weakness:**
  - Upper extremity: flexors stronger than extensors (flexed posture)
  - Lower extremity: extensors stronger than flexors (extended, stiff leg)
- **Positive pronator drift:** Arm pronates and drifts downward with eyes closed

**Caveat:** Acute UMN injury (stroke, spinal shock) initially presents with flaccidity and decreased reflexes, then develops classic UMN signs in the subacute/chronic stage.

### Visual Pathway Lesions

Lesions produce characteristic visual field defects (anopsias):

1. **Right homonymous hemianopsia:** Lesion in left visual fibers posterior to optic chiasm
2. **Right superior quadrantanopsia ("pie in the sky"):** Lesion in left Meyer's loop (inferior temporal lobe)
3. **Left monocular vision loss:** Lesion before optic chiasm (left eye or left optic nerve)
4. **Bitemporal hemianopsia:** Lesion at optic chiasm (e.g., pituitary adenoma, Sheehan's apoplexy)

### Facial Weakness: UMN vs. LMN

**UMN facial weakness (forehead sparing):**
- Lower 2/3 of face weak contralateral to brain lesion
- Forehead movement preserved due to bilateral innervation
- Most common cause: stroke

**LMN facial weakness (entire hemi-face):**
- Whole half of face weak ipsilateral to CN VII lesion
- Unable to raise eyebrow or close eye
- May have associated taste disturbance (chorda tympani) or hyperacusis (stapedial nerve)
- Most common cause: Bell's palsy

### Brainstem/Posterior Fossa Signs (The "D's")

- **Diplopia:** Double vision
- **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing
- **Dysequilibrium:** Imbalance
- **Dyscoordination/Dysmetria:** Poor coordination, overshoot/undershoot
- **Dysconjugate gaze:** Eyes not moving together
- **Dizziness:** Can be central or peripheral
- **Cranial nerve palsies:** CN III-XII deficits localize ipsilaterally
- **"Crossed signs":** Ipsilateral face + contralateral body deficits (indicates decussation level)

### Cerebellar Signs

The cerebellum modulates motor systems to produce smooth, coordinated movements:

- **Truncal ataxia:** Lesion in vermis/flocculonodular lobe causes wide-based, staggering gait
- **Limb (appendicular) ataxia:** Lesion in lateral hemispheres causes ipsilateral limb dyscoordination (fibers are double-crossed)
- **Dysmetria:** Overshoot or undershoot when reaching for targets
- **Intention tremor:** Tremor increases on approach to target
- **Dysdiadochokinesia:** Impaired rapid alternating movements
- **Poor tandem walking**
- **Normal to low tone**
- **Pure motor symptoms** (no sensory deficits)

### Basal Ganglia (Extrapyramidal) Signs

Lesions produce contralateral motor deficits:

- **Abnormal movements (dyskinesias):** Can be slow (bradykinesia) or fast (tremor, chorea)
- **Huntington's disease:** Hyperkinetic movements (choreoathetosis - fast, jerky, writhing)
- **Parkinson's disease:**
  - Rest tremor
  - Bradykinesia (hypokinetic movements)
  - Rigidity (lead-pipe tone throughout movement arc)
  - Postural instability
  - Parkinsonian gait (reduced arm swing, stooped posture, shuffling, festinating steps)

### Spinal Cord Signs

- **No cognitive impairment** (no cortical signs)
- **Deficits only below the level of the lesion** (no head/cranial nerve involvement)
- **Spinal sensory level:** Can identify the vertebral level
- **UMN signs below the lesion** (in subacute/chronic phase)
- **Bladder/bowel dysfunction** common
- **Crossed sensory deficits possible** (e.g., Brown-Séquard syndrome)

## PNS Patterns for Localization

### Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) Signs

General features indicating PNS localization:

- **No cognitive problems**
- **Hyporeflexia or areflexia**
- **Flaccidity/Hypotonia:** Decreased tone
- **Atrophy:** Loss of muscle bulk following nerve distribution
- **Fasciculations:** Spontaneous muscle twitches
- **Sensory +/- motor deficits** following nerve distribution(s)

### Specific PNS Patterns

**Polyneuropathy:**
- Symmetric distal stocking-glove sensorimotor deficits
- Hypo- or absent reflexes
- Length-dependent (longest nerves affected first)
- Example: diabetic polyneuropathy

**Myopathy (muscle disease):**
- Symmetric proximal > distal weakness (shoulder-hip girdle)
- Preserved reflexes (until late disease)
- No sensory deficits
- Pure motor problem
- Example: muscular dystrophy, inflammatory myopathies

**Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ):**
- Pure motor symptoms
- Preserved reflexes
- Fatiguable weakness (worsens with repetitive use)
- No sensory deficits
- Example: myasthenia gravis

**Motor Neuron Disease (anterior horn cells):**
- Combination of UMN + LMN signs
- Pure motor problem
- Fasciculations, atrophy, weakness with hyperreflexia, spasticity
- No sensory involvement
- Example: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

**Individual Nerve Lesions:**
- Sensory +/- motor deficits in specific nerve distribution
- Example: ulnar neuropathy (numbness of little finger and half of ring finger)

**High Steppage Gait:**
- Classic LMN sign
- Foot drop due to ankle dorsiflexion weakness
- Lifts leg higher to clear the ground
- Foot slaps down
- Causes: peroneal nerve palsy, L5 radiculopathy, polyneuropathy

## Neuroanatomy Review

### Primary Motor System (Descending)

- **Primary motor cortex** → descending corticobulbar tract (CBT) + corticospinal tract (CST)
- **Decussation at pyramids** in the medulla
- **Lateral and anterior CST** in spinal cord → synapse at anterior horn cells
- **Injury to CST** = UMN signs

### Primary Somatosensory System (Ascending - Dorsal Columns)

- Mediates light touch, vibration, proprioception (joint position sense)
- Ascends ipsilaterally through dorsal columns of spinal cord
- Legs: medial (gracile fasciculus)
- Arms: lateral (cuneate fasciculus)
- Decussates in medulla as medial lemniscus
- Synapses in thalamus (VPL) → primary sensory cortex

### Spinothalamic Tract (Ascending)

- Mediates pain and temperature
- Enters dorsal root → ascends 2-3 segments in Lissauer's tract
- Crosses ventral commissure to contralateral anterior spinal cord
- Ascends as spinothalamic tract
- Synapses in thalamus (VPL) → primary sensory cortex

### Brown-Séquard Syndrome (Cord Hemisection)

Classic example demonstrating spinal cord anatomy:

1. **Ipsilateral band of sensory loss** at the level (dorsal root input)
2. **Ipsilateral loss of proprioception, vibration, light touch** below lesion (dorsal columns)
3. **Ipsilateral hemiparesis, hyperreflexia, spasticity** below lesion (lateral CST)
4. **Contralateral loss of pain and temperature** 2-3 segments below lesion (spinothalamic tract)

## Summary: Take Home Points

1. **History is paramount:** Be a thorough detective
2. **Use the 3-step approach systematically** before ordering tests
3. **Distinguish CNS from PNS patterns** and recognize common groupings
4. **Localize on both Y-axis and X-axis** using neuroanatomy
5. **Aphasias are cortical signs:** Broca's (expressive) vs. Wernicke's (receptive)
6. **Visual field defects:** Lesions behind the optic chiasm affect both eyes
7. **Facial weakness localization:** Central (forehead-sparing) vs. peripheral (entire hemi-face)

This systematic approach will be applied throughout the neurology block and clerkship to all patients encountered.
