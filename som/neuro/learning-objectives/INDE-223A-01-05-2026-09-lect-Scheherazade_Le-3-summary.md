# Secondary Headaches - Lecture Summary
**Lecturer:** Dr. Scheherazade Le, MD
**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Course:** INDE-223A

## Overview
This lecture focuses on secondary headaches, which have an underlying structural or pathological cause (tumor, infection, hemorrhage, vascular malformation, etc.). Secondary headaches represent approximately 10% of all headaches but require urgent evaluation due to potentially life-threatening etiologies.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Differentiate Between Primary and Secondary Headaches

**Primary Headaches (90% of all headaches):**
- No underlying structural or worrisome cause
- Examples: migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache
- Symptoms alone cause the disorder

**Secondary Headaches (10% of all headaches):**
- Due to underlying structural or exogenous problem
- Causes include:
  - Head/neck trauma
  - Cranial/cervical vascular disorders (dissection)
  - Non-vascular intracranial disorders (tumor, idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
  - Substance use or withdrawal
  - Infection (meningitis, encephalitis)
  - Disorder of homeostasis
  - Structural disorders of head/face
  - Psychiatric disorders

### 2. Evaluate for Red Flags and SNOOP Features of Worrisome Headaches

The **SNOOP** mnemonic identifies concerning features requiring workup:

**S - Systemic symptoms or illness**
- Fever, rash, persistent vomiting
- Pregnancy/post-partum
- Cancer, immunocompromised state
- Anticoagulation, oral contraceptives
- Family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage

**N - Neurologic symptoms or signs**
- Focal neurologic findings
- Altered mental status
- Seizure, syncope
- Papilledema
- Stiff neck (meningismus)

**O - Onset: first or worst, sudden**
- "Thunderclap" headache (reaches maximum in seconds to minutes)
- New headache in patients <5 or >40 years old
- Assumes subarachnoid hemorrhage until proven otherwise

**O - Other associated conditions**
- Head trauma
- Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): worse with Valsalva/sex/strenuous exercise
- Awakens from sleep
- Postural (worse with standing) or after lumbar puncture

**P - Prior headache history is different**
- Worsening pattern
- Rapidly progressive in severity/frequency
- Medication overuse headache

---

### 3. Name the Signs of Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)

The skull is a fixed vault. Signs of increased ICP include:

- **Headaches worse with:**
  - Position (lying down, bending over)
  - Valsalva maneuvers (straining, coughing, sneezing)
  - Awakening from sleep

- **Cranial nerve findings:**
  - Bilateral CN VI palsies (or unilateral)
  - CN VI has the longest intracranial course, most susceptible to stretch
  - Causes horizontal diplopia (double vision)

- **Visual symptoms:**
  - Papilledema (optic disc swelling)
  - Visual field loss
  - Transient visual obscurations

- **Associated symptoms:**
  - Nausea and vomiting

---

### 4. List Indications and Contraindications for Lumbar Puncture

**Indications:**
- Suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage with negative CT
- CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis)
- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (measure opening pressure)
- Intracranial hypotension
- Multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome evaluation
- Meningeal carcinomatosis

**MUST Image Before LP if Patient Has:**
- Altered mental status/coma
- Recent seizure
- Focal neurologic deficits including papilledema
- Immunocompromised state

**Contraindications:**
- Lesion on neuroimaging or increased ICP that puts patient at risk for fatal brain herniation
- Spinal epidural abscess
- Coagulation defects/active bleeding:
  - INR > 1.4
  - Platelets < 50,000

---

### 5. Evaluate Acute Onset "Worst or Thunderclap Headache" for Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

**Key Concept:** Sudden severe headache ("worst headache of life") followed by collapse suggests brain hemorrhage, most commonly subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

**Diagnostic Approach:**
1. **CT head immediately**
   - Detects blood in 92% of SAH within 24 hours
   - Hyperdense (bright) appearance of blood in subarachnoid space

2. **If CT negative BUT high suspicion → Lumbar puncture**
   - Look for xanthochromia (yellow CSF from blood breakdown products)
   - Xanthochromia may not appear for 2 hours after symptom onset
   - RBC count does not decline from tube 1 to tube 4 (vs. traumatic tap)

3. **Vascular imaging:** CTA or MRA to identify aneurysm

**SAH Characteristics:**
- Most commonly from ruptured berry aneurysm
- Common locations: junctions of Circle of Willis vessels
- Risk factors: hypertension, smoking, family history
- Can present with meningismus, nausea/vomiting, loss of consciousness
- Morbidity/mortality: 1/3 die, 1/3 significant disability, 1/3 good outcome

---

### 6. Recall That Aneurysms Can Be Treated Surgically or Endovascularly

**Treatment Goal:** Secure aneurysm quickly before rebleeding occurs

**Surgical Clipping:**
- Open neurosurgery
- Place clip across neck of aneurysm
- Prevents blood flow into aneurysm sac

**Endovascular Coiling:**
- Performed by Neurointerventional Radiology
- Insert metal coils into aneurysm via catheter
- Causes coagulation within aneurysm
- May be assisted by stenting
- Similar or better complication rate than surgery

**Choice depends on:**
- Location and accessibility of aneurysm
- Anatomy (width of neck)
- Patient factors

**Management of Unruptured Aneurysms:**
- Controversy exists
- 0.5-2% per year bleeding risk
- If <8mm in anterior circulation, may observe

### 7. Describe Trigeminal Neuralgia (Cranial Neuralgia)

**Definition:** Recurrent unilateral brief electric shock-like pains in distribution of trigeminal nerve (CN V)

**Clinical Features:**
- Abrupt onset and termination
- Limited to CN V distribution (most often V2, V3)
- Triggered by non-noxious stimuli:
  - Eating, cold air, touch, wind
- Pain: severe, lancinating, stabbing
- Also called "tic douloureux"

**Classification:**
- **Primary (classical):** No identifiable structural cause
- **Secondary:** Due to vascular compression, tumor, MS plaque

**Diagnostic Workup:**
- MRI brain to assess for:
  - Vascular loop compressing nerve at root entry zone
  - Structural lesions (tumor)
  - MS plaques

**Medical Treatment:**
- Carbamazepine or similar Na+ channel blockers (very effective)
- Side effects: drowsiness, dizziness, GI upset, hyponatremia, imbalance
- **Important:** Asians with HLA-B1502 allele at increased risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome with carbamazepine → use alternative agent

**Surgical Treatment:**
- If medical therapy fails and vascular loop present
- Microvascular decompression (MVD): separate vascular loop from CN V root entry zone using pledgets

### 8. Recall Neuroanatomy of Circle of Willis and Cranial Nerves II, V, VI, VII, VIII

#### **Circle of Willis:**
Common aneurysm locations marked at vessel junctions:
- Anterior communicating artery
- Posterior communicating artery
- Middle cerebral artery bifurcation
- Basilar tip
- Ophthalmic artery origin

**Anterior Circulation:**
- Internal carotid artery → anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery

**Posterior Circulation:**
- Vertebral arteries → basilar artery → posterior cerebral arteries
- Superior cerebellar, anterior inferior cerebellar, posterior inferior cerebellar arteries

#### **Cranial Nerve Anatomy:**

**CN II (Optic Nerve):**
- Mediates vision
- Test: funduscopic exam, visual fields
- Papilledema = optic disc swelling from increased ICP
- Normal optic disc: sharp, crisp edges

**CN V (Trigeminal Nerve):**
- Three divisions: V1 (ophthalmic), V2 (maxillary), V3 (mandibular)
- **Exit points (SRO mnemonic):**
  - V1: Superior orbital fissure
  - V2: foramen Rotundum
  - V3: foramen Ovale
- Sensory: face, mouth, anterior 2/3 tongue, nasal sinuses, supratentorial meninges
- Motor: muscles of mastication (masseter, temporalis, pterygoids)

**CN VI (Abducens Nerve):**
- Controls lateral rectus muscle (eye abduction)
- Longest intracranial course → most susceptible to increased ICP
- Lesion causes horizontal diplopia, inability to abduct eye

**CN VII (Facial Nerve):**
- Controls muscles of facial expression
- Upper motor neuron lesion: contralateral lower face weakness (forehead spared)
- Lower motor neuron lesion: entire ipsilateral hemiface affected

**CN VIII (Vestibulocochlear Nerve):**
- Hearing and balance
- Acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas) common in NF-2
- Bilateral involvement classic for neurofibromatosis type 2

## Neuroimaging Approach

**When to Use CT vs. MRI:**

**CT Head (acute settings):**
- Acute headache concerning for SAH, bleed, trauma
- Quickly detects blood, mass lesions
- Hyperdense (bright): blood, bone, calcium, contrast

**MRI Brain ± Contrast (non-acute):**
- Preferred for subacute/chronic headaches
- More detailed anatomical information
- Gadolinium contrast: highlights blood-brain-barrier breakdown
- Detects: tumors, infection, inflammation, demyelination

**Vascular Imaging:**
- MRA/MRV or CTA if considering vascular causes
- Visualizes aneurysms, dissection, stenosis, venous thrombosis

---

## Important Diagnostic Algorithms

### Approach to Secondary Headache:
1. **History & Physical** → Identify SNOOP features
2. **If SNOOP present** → Workup for secondary cause
3. **Neuroimaging:**
   - CT head for acute presentations
   - MRI brain ± contrast for non-acute
4. **Consider LP** if:
   - Negative CT but high suspicion for SAH
   - Concern for infection
   - Measuring opening pressure for IIH
5. **If negative workup** → Treat as primary headache

### 3-Step Neurologic Diagnosis (used throughout):
1. **Formulate key symptoms/signs + establish time course**
2. **Localize lesion** (Y-axis: CNS level; X-axis: lateralization)
3. **Etiological diagnosis using "I MIND THE VIP":**
   - Infectious, Metabolic, Iatrogenic, Neoplastic
   - Degenerative/Developmental/Demyelinating
   - Toxic/Traumatic, Hereditary, Endocrine/Epileptic
   - Vascular, Inflammatory, Psychiatric

## Take-Home Points

1. **Primary vs. Secondary:** Know the key distinguishing features; 90% are primary, 10% secondary
2. **SNOOP is critical:** Systematically evaluate all headache patients for red flags
3. **Thunderclap headache = SAH until proven otherwise:** CT head + LP if negative
4. **Increased ICP signs:** Worse with Valsalva/lying down, awakens from sleep, CN VI palsies, papilledema
5. **LP contraindications:** Must image first if altered mental status, seizure, focal deficits, immunocompromised
6. **CT sensitivity for SAH:** Only 92% within 24 hours → LP mandatory if high suspicion and negative CT
7. **Aneurysm treatment:** Both surgical clipping and endovascular coiling are effective options
8. **Circle of Willis anatomy:** Know common aneurysm locations at vessel junctions
9. **Cranial nerve localization:** Essential for diagnosing specific syndromes (especially CN II, V, VI, VII, VIII)
10. **Trigeminal neuralgia:** Brief lancinating pain in CN V distribution, treated with carbamazepine or MVD
