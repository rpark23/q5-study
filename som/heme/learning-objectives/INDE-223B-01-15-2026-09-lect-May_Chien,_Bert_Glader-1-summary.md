---

## I. Laboratory Evaluation of Hemolysis

### What is Hemolysis?

- **RBC lifespan:** ~120 days normally
- **Normal RBC destruction:** ~1% daily
- **Hemolysis:** Accelerated destruction of red blood cells

### Laboratory Markers of Hemolysis

**Key Lab Changes:**

1. **Increased Reticulocyte Count**
   - Indicates accelerated RBC production by bone marrow
   - Bone marrow responds to anemia by releasing immature RBCs

2. **Decreased Haptoglobin**
   - Free hemoglobin binds to haptoglobin
   - Hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is rapidly cleared by liver
   - Result: Low plasma haptoglobin levels

3. **Elevated LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)**
   - Released from RBCs during hemolysis
   - Non-specific marker but useful

4. **Elevated Total and Indirect Bilirubin**
   - Hemoglobin → Heme → Biliverdin → Unconjugated bilirubin
   - Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin predominates in hemolysis

### Types of Hemolysis

**Intravascular Hemolysis** (within blood vessels):
- Urine hemosiderin
- Hemoglobinuria (pink/dark urine)
- Schistocytes on peripheral smear

**Extravascular Hemolysis** (via macrophages in spleen, liver, bone marrow):
- Spherocytes on peripheral smear
- Most common type

**Note:** Distinction can be blurred clinically—one system can be overwhelmed and extend to the other.

### Clinical Features of Hemolysis

- Signs and symptoms of anemia
- Jaundice
- Dark urine
- Gallstones
- Splenomegaly

---

## III. Hemoglobinopathies

### Normal Hemoglobin Structure

- **HbA (Adult hemoglobin):** α₂β₂ (predominant adult form)
- **HbF (Fetal hemoglobin):** α₂γ₂ (predominant fetal form)
- **HbA2 (Minor adult hemoglobin):** α₂δ₂

**Key Developmental Fact:** Beta chains don't reach normal levels until 3-6 months of age, so beta-globin disorders (like beta-thalassemia) don't manifest until after this period.

### A. Thalassemia

**Definition:** Inherited defects in globin chain biosynthesis

**Origin of term:** Greek for "the sea" (Mediterranean), as it was first described in populations from Italian and Greek coasts.

**Geographic distribution:** Most common in areas historically affected by endemic malaria (selective advantage for heterozygotes).

#### Pathophysiology

**Key Concept:** It's not the deficiency itself that causes problems—it's the **imbalance** that results in excess of the remaining globin chain.

**Mechanism:**
1. Decreased production of α or β globins
2. Imbalance between α and β globins
3. Excess globin chains precipitate and damage RBC membrane
4. **Ineffective erythropoiesis:** Destruction of RBC precursors in bone marrow (intramedullary hemolysis)
5. Results in:
   - Anemia
   - Bone marrow expansion
   - Extramedullary hematopoiesis
   - Increased intestinal iron absorption

#### Alpha Thalassemia

**Genetics:** 4 alpha-globin genes (2 on each chromosome 16)

| Genotype | α genes | Name | Severity |
|----------|---------|------|----------|
| αα/αα | 4 | Normal | - |
| αα/α- | 3 | Silent carrier | Minor |
| --/αα or α-/α- | 2 | Thalassemia trait | Minor |
| --/α- | 1 | HbH disease | Intermedia/NTDT |
| --/-- | 0 | Hydrops fetalis | Major/TDT |

**HbH Disease:**
- Moderately severe but variable anemia
- HbH (β₄ tetramers) is unstable and precipitates
- Osseous changes and splenomegaly

**Hydrops Fetalis:**
- Most common in Mediterranean and East Asian populations
- Usually stillborn or die shortly after birth
- **Note:** Gene therapy now offers potential cure

#### Beta Thalassemia

**Genetics:** 2 beta-globin genes (1 on each chromosome 11)

**Classifications:**
- β⁺ = decreased beta-globin production
- β⁰ = absent beta-globin production

| Genotype | Description | Classification |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| β/β | Normal | - |
| β/β⁺ or β/β⁰ | Beta thalassemia trait (minor) | NTDT |
| β⁺/β⁺, βᴱ/β⁺, βᴱ/βᴱ | Beta thalassemia intermedia | NTDT |
| β⁰/β⁰ | Beta thalassemia major (Cooley's Anemia) | TDT |

**Modern Classification:**
- **TDT (Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia):** Requires ≥8 transfusions/year
- **NTDT (Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia):** May require intermittent transfusions

#### Clinical Features

**Thalassemia Major:**
- Anemia
- Maxilla overgrowth and frontal bossing (from bone marrow expansion)
- Failure to thrive
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Symptoms typically appear after 3-6 months of age (when beta-globin should increase)

#### Laboratory Findings

1. **Decreased MCV, increased RBC count**
   - Less hemoglobin = less cytoplasm = smaller cells
   - RBC number can be elevated despite anemia

2. **Target cells** on smear
   - Excess membrane compared to cytoplasm

3. **Beta thalassemia specific:**
   - **Increased HbA2** on hemoglobin electrophoresis (diagnostic!)
   - Why? With decreased beta chains, delta chains are relatively increased

4. **Alpha thalassemia specific:**
   - HbH may be unstable and variably detected
   - Requires genetic testing for definitive diagnosis

#### Treatment

- **Cure:** Stem cell transplantation or gene therapy (FDA approved 2022)
- **Chronic transfusions** ("hypertransfusion")
- **Chelation therapy** for iron overload
- **Splenectomy** for marked hypersplenism

### B. Sickle Cell Anemia

#### Molecular Basis

**Mutation:** GAG→GTG in HBB gene
- Creates β⁶Glu→Val substitution
- Results in Hemoglobin S (HbS)

**Key Property:** At low oxygen tension, HbS polymerizes into densely packed fibers
- Process is reversible upon reoxygenation
- Polymerization distorts RBC into sickle shape

#### Epidemiology

**Global Distribution:**
- ~300 million affected worldwide
- Highest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (>25%)
- Confers protection against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria

**United States:**
- 1/365 African Americans (~100,000 prevalence)
- 1/140 Hispanics
- 1/300 Whites
- >90% of children now survive to adulthood
- Life expectancy: 50-60 years (20 years below average)

#### Pathophysiology

**Complex cascade:**

1. **HbS polymerization** upon deoxygenation
2. **Sickling** causes:
   - RBC membrane damage
   - Cellular dehydration
   - Further HbS concentration → more sickling

3. **Hemolysis:**
   - Intravascular and extravascular
   - Free heme scavenges nitric oxide (NO)
   - Reduced NO → vasoconstriction

4. **Vaso-occlusion:**
   - Adhesion of sickled cells to endothelium
   - Inflammation
   - Increased blood viscosity
   - Results in tissue ischemia and pain

#### Clinical Spectrum

| Genotype | Name | Hb (g/dL) | MCV (fL) | Retic (%) | Severity |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| βˢβˢ | Sickle cell anemia (SS) | 6-9 | nl | 10-25 | 4+ |
| βˢβᶜ | Sickle-Hb C disease (SC) | 9-12 | nl or ↓ | 5-10 | 2+ |
| βˢβ⁺ | Sickle-β⁺-thalassemia | 10-13 | ↓ | 5-10 | 1-2+ |
| βˢβ⁰ | Sickle-β⁰-thalassemia | 6-9 | ↓ | 10-25 | 4+ |

#### Clinical Manifestations

**Chronic Hemolytic Anemia:**
- Jaundice, pallor, fatigue
- Parvovirus infection → aplastic crisis
- Cholelithiasis (bilirubin gallstones)
- Endothelial dysfunction (from reduced NO)

**Acute Complications (Vaso-occlusive Events):**
- Pain crises (dactylitis)
- Acute chest syndrome
- Splenic sequestration
- Aplastic crisis
- Overt stroke

**Chronic Organ Damage:**
- Spleen (autoinfarction)
- Brain (silent strokes, cognitive impairment)
- Kidneys
- Lungs
- Bones
- Eyes
- Heart

**Susceptibility to Infection:**
- Functional asplenia (from repeated infarction)

#### Social Context

**Important Note:** The role of structural and interpersonal racism in sickle cell disease cannot be ignored:
- Inadequate research funding
- Patients often stigmatized as drug seekers
- Results in inadequate pain management and suffering

## IV. RBC Membrane Defects

### RBC Membrane Structure

**Three Components:**

1. **Lipid Bilayer:**
   - Phospholipids arranged in bilayer
   - Cholesterol in hydrophobic core

2. **Intrinsic Membrane Proteins:**
   - Traverse lipid bilayer
   - **Band 3:** Anion transport channel
   - Provides attachment for cytoskeleton

3. **Membrane Cytoskeleton:**
   - Network of spectrin, actin, ankyrin, Band 4.1, etc.
   - Confers resilient elasticity to membrane

**Vertical Forces:** Between skeleton and lipid bilayer (perpendicular)
**Horizontal Forces:** Within cytoskeletal lattice (parallel)

### A. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)

#### Pathophysiology

**Defect:** Decreased vertical forces between skeleton and lipid bilayer

**Affected Proteins:**
- Spectrin deficiency
- Ankyrin deficiency
- Band 3 deficiency
- Band 4.2 deficiency

**Consequences:**
1. Membrane loss and destabilization
2. Loss of surface area
3. Formation of **spherocytes** (cells with decreased surface-to-volume ratio)
4. Decreased deformability
5. Splenic trapping and destruction

#### Epidemiology

- Most common hemolytic disorder in Northern European descent
- Prevalence: ≥0.02% of this population

#### Clinical Features

- Anemia
- Jaundice
- Splenomegaly
- Cholelithiasis

**Hemolytic Crises:**
- Often triggered by infection
- Worsening jaundice, increased splenomegaly
- More profound anemia with reticulocytosis

**Aplastic Crises:**
- Due to parvovirus B19 infection
- Fever, abdominal pain, vomiting
- Worsening anemia with **reticulocytopenia**

#### Laboratory Findings

1. **Peripheral smear:** Numerous microspherocytes and polychromatic reticulocytes
2. **Elevated MCHC** (from membrane loss)
3. **Negative direct antiglobulin test** (DAT) - to exclude immune hemolysis
4. **Positive osmotic fragility test:**
   - Spherocytes hemolyze at higher salt concentrations
   - Due to inability to swell (already at maximum volume/surface ratio)

### B. Hereditary Elliptocytosis (HE)

#### Pathophysiology

**Defect:** Decreased horizontal forces in cytoskeletal lattice

**Affected Proteins:**
- Spectrin
- Band 4.1
- Portions involved in spectrin polymerization

**Consequences:**
- Destabilization of membrane
- Fragmentation
- Elliptical cell shape

#### Clinical Features

- **Variable severity:** Asymptomatic carrier state to severe hemolytic disease
- **Diagnostic criterion:** ≥25% elliptocytes on smear (vs ≤10% normal)

## V. RBC Enzyme Defects

### RBC Metabolism Background

**RBCs must protect against oxidative damage:**
- During oxygen delivery, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated
- ROS causes protein damage, membrane rigidity, decreased survival

**Two Key Pathways:**

1. **Embden-Meyerhof (Glycolytic) Pathway:**
   - Generates ATP for membrane function
   - Deficiency → ATP deficiency → hemolysis

2. **Pentose Phosphate Shunt (Hexose Monophosphate Shunt):**
   - Generates NADPH
   - NADPH reduces GSSG → GSH (reduced glutathione)
   - GSH protects against oxidant damage
   - Deficiency → oxidant damage → hemolysis

### A. G6PD Deficiency

#### Pathophysiology

**G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase):**
- First enzyme in pentose phosphate shunt
- Essential for generating NADPH
- NADPH needed to maintain GSH in reduced state

**When G6PD is Deficient:**
1. Decreased NADPH production
2. Decreased GSH → increased oxidant damage
3. **Hemoglobin oxidation:**
   - Methemoglobin (reversible)
   - Sulfhemoglobin (irreversible)
   - **Heinz bodies** (precipitated, denatured globin)
4. Membrane protein aggregation
5. Rigid membranes → hemolysis

**Spleen "pits" Heinz bodies → characteristic "bite cells" on smear**

#### Genetics

- **X-linked recessive** inheritance
- High prevalence in:
  - Kurdish Jews
  - West African Americans
  - African Americans (~10%)
  - Chinese
  - Southeast Asian
  - Mediterranean

**Malaria Protection:** Selective advantage in malaria-endemic regions

#### Clinical Classification

**Class I:** Severe chronic hemolysis (rare)

**Class II:** Severe enzyme deficiency, episodic hemolysis
- **Favism:** Severe intravascular hemolysis after fava bean ingestion
- Symptoms: Headache, dizziness, fever, chills, jaundice, hemoglobinuria
- Heinz bodies on smear

**Class III:** Moderate deficiency, episodic hemolysis with triggers
- **Most common form:** G6PD A- (10% of African Americans)
- Enzyme is inherently unstable
- Older RBCs have lowest G6PD activity → most susceptible
- Younger RBCs protected → hemolysis is self-limited

**Triggers for Hemolysis:**
- Oxidant drugs
- Severe infection
- Fava beans (in Class II)

#### Clinical Features

**Most patients:** Asymptomatic until exposed to trigger

**During Hemolytic Episode:**
- Acute anemia
- Jaundice
- Dark urine (hemoglobinuria)
- Heinz bodies, bite cells on smear

#### Laboratory Diagnosis

**G6PD enzyme level measurement**

**Important:** Should be measured **outside** of hemolytic episode
- During acute hemolysis, older cells destroyed
- Remaining younger cells have normal G6PD
- May give false-negative result

### B. Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Deficiency

#### Pathophysiology

**PK:** Final enzyme in glycolytic pathway
- Converts phosphoenolpyruvate → pyruvate
- Generates ATP

**Deficiency:**
- ATP deficiency
- Impaired membrane function
- Hemolysis

**Most common enzymopathy of glycolytic pathway**

#### Clinical Features

- **Variable severity:** Transfusion-dependent to well-compensated
- Unlike G6PD, **chronic hemolysis** is common
- No characteristic morphologic changes on smear

#### Diagnosis

- Measure red cell PK activity
- Consider in chronic hemolysis without membrane or hemoglobinopathy

## VI. Summary

### Key Laboratory Markers of Hemolysis

| Test | Change | Mechanism |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Reticulocyte count | ↑ | Bone marrow response |
| Haptoglobin | ↓ | Binds free Hb, cleared by liver |
| LDH | ↑ | Released from RBCs |
| Indirect bilirubin | ↑ | Hb breakdown product |

### Classification Framework

**Intrinsic (RBC defect):**
1. **Hemoglobinopathies**
   - Thalassemia (α or β)
   - Sickle cell disease

2. **Membranopathies**
   - Hereditary spherocytosis (vertical defect)
   - Hereditary elliptocytosis (horizontal defect)

3. **Enzymopathies**
   - G6PD deficiency (pentose shunt)
   - Pyruvate kinase deficiency (glycolysis)

**Extrinsic (environmental cause):**
- Immune-mediated (AIHA, transfusion reactions)
- Non-immune (mechanical, infection, toxins)
- *Will be covered in future lectures*

### Clinical Pearls

1. **Thalassemia:** Think imbalance, not just deficiency
2. **Beta-thalassemia:** Symptoms after 3-6 months (when beta should increase)
3. **Increased HbA2:** Diagnostic for beta-thalassemia trait
4. **Sickle cell:** Malaria protection explains prevalence
5. **Spherocytosis:** Check DAT to exclude immune cause
6. **G6PD:** Most have no symptoms unless triggered
7. **G6PD testing:** Do outside of hemolytic crisis for accuracy
8. **PK deficiency:** Consider in unexplained chronic hemolysis
