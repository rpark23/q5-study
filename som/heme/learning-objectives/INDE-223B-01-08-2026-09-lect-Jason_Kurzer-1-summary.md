## Overview of Hematopoiesis

### Definition
**Hematopoiesis** is the generation of blood cells from precursor cells via an interplay of growth factors and a specialized microenvironment. The system must maintain cell counts and increase production in times of need.

### Cellular Hierarchy

**Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)**
- Multipotential with self-renewal capability
- Smallest hematopoietic compartment (~2×10⁴ cells)
- Mostly quiescent
- Can generate all lineages of blood cells

**Progenitor Cells**
- Derived from HSCs
- Progressively committed to specific lineages
- Lack self-renewal capability
- Include multipotent progenitors (MPP), common myeloid progenitor (CMP), and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP)

**Maturing Precursor Cells**
- Committed to specific lineages
- Undergo terminal differentiation

### Key Growth Factors

| Growth Factor | Function | Clinical Use |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Kit ligand (SCF)** | Essential for hematopoiesis, including mast cell development | - |
| **Flt3 ligand** | Important for myeloid progenitor and lymphoid production | - |
| **Erythropoietin (EPO)** | Essential for erythrocyte production | Treat anemia; also misused in sports doping |
| **Thrombopoietin (TPO)** | Important for platelet production, influenced by platelet numbers | - |
| **G-CSF** | Important for granulocyte production and mobilization | Treat neutropenia and mobilize HSCs |
| **IL-5** | Eosinophil production | - |
| **IL-7** | B-cell and T-cell development | - |

### Localization Throughout Life

**Embryonic and Fetal Development**:
1. **Yolk sac** (primitive hematopoiesis, ~18 days post-fertilization)
2. **Aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM)** and **placenta** (~4 weeks, definitive hematopoiesis begins)
3. **Fetal liver** (chief site by 5 weeks through birth)
4. **Bone marrow** (begins ~14 weeks, becomes primary site at 6-7 months)

**Postnatal**:
- **Bone marrow**: Exclusive site under normal circumstances
- In newborns, all bones produce blood cells
- With age, production shifts to axial skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, pelvis)
- Bone marrow cellularity decreases with age (>90% at birth to ~30% in elderly)
- In stress conditions, extramedullary hematopoiesis can occur in liver and spleen

### Clinical Assessment Procedures

**Bone Marrow Biopsy**
- Preserves architecture and cellularity
- Fibrotic areas well-represented
- Can perform immunohistochemical stains
- Takes time to process (at least 1 day)
- Genetic material may be damaged by decalcification

**Bone Marrow Aspirate**
- Immediate interpretation possible
- Cytology well-represented
- Can be used for molecular testing, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics
- Does not show bone, stroma, or fibrotic areas
- Cannot perform in situ stains

## Erythrocytic Hematopoiesis

### Erythropoiesis Process

**Duration**: 5-8 days from CFU-E to mature erythrocyte

**Maturation Sequence**:
1. **Pro-erythroblast**: Prominent nucleolus, basophilic cytoplasm
2. **Basophilic erythroblast**: Bluish tinge from ribosomal RNA
3. **Polychromatophilic erythroblast**: Mixed blue-pink color as hemoglobin synthesis begins
4. **Orthochromatic erythroblast**: Condensed nucleus, pinkish cytoplasm (80% of hemoglobin synthesized)
5. **Reticulocyte**: Enucleated, residual RNA (remaining 20% of hemoglobin synthesized)
6. **Erythrocyte**: Mature red blood cell

**Production Rate**: ~200 billion (2×10¹¹) erythrocytes per day

### Erythropoietin (EPO) Regulation

**Site of Production**: Renal cortex (liver to lesser extent in adults)

**Stimulus**: Low arterial oxygen pressure (pO₂)

**Mechanism**:
- O₂-sensing cells in renal tubules detect hypoxia
- Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is stabilized
- HIF induces transcription of erythropoietin
- EPO binds to erythroid progenitors via EPO receptor
- **JAK2 tyrosine kinase** mediates downstream signaling
- Stimulates survival and proliferation of erythroid cells

### Red Blood Cell Function

**Primary Function**: Gas transportation
- Delivers oxygen from lungs to peripheral tissues via hemoglobin
- Returns carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs
- Lacks mitochondria for its own metabolism

**Key Characteristics**:
- Flexible biconcave disc shape (cytoskeleton proteins maintain shape)
- Allows passage through narrow capillaries
- Lifespan: 120 days

### Hemoglobin Structure and Function

**Structure**:
- Tetramer: Two α-like chains (141 aa) and two β-like chains (146 aa)
- Each chain contains a heme group
- Heme binds oxygen via ferrous iron (Fe²⁺)
- Cooperative binding: binding of O₂ to one subunit facilitates binding to others

**Forms**:
- **Oxyhemoglobin**: Oxygen-bound form
- **Carboxyhemoglobin**: Carbon monoxide-bound (dangerous)
- **Methemoglobin**: Fe³⁺ form (cannot bind oxygen efficiently)

**Additional Functions**:
- Nitric oxide transport and metabolism (important for vascular tone)
- Free hemoglobin from hemolysis can:
  - Scavenge NO, impairing vasodilation
  - Activate endothelium, increasing inflammation
  - Promote platelet adhesion and clot formation

### Hemoglobin-Oxygen Dissociation Curve

**Normal Conditions**: Sigmoidal curve with P50 at ~27 mmHg

**Right Shift (Decreased O₂ Affinity → Easier O₂ Release)**:
- Increased pCO₂
- Decreased pH (increased H⁺, acidosis)
- Increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)
- Increased temperature (fever)
- Low affinity hemoglobin variants (e.g., HbS - sickle cell)

**Left Shift (Increased O₂ Affinity → Reduced O₂ Delivery)**:
- Decreased pCO₂
- Increased pH (decreased H⁺, alkalosis)
- Decreased 2,3-BPG
- Decreased temperature
- Fetal hemoglobin (HbF)
- Carboxyhemoglobin
- Methemoglobin

**Clinical Significance**:
- High altitude triggers increased 2,3-BPG production
- Allows better oxygen unloading to tissues despite lower atmospheric O₂
- Exercise generates CO₂ and lactic acid, facilitating O₂ release

### Heme Biosynthesis

**Primary Rate-Limiting Step**: δ-ALA synthase

**Pathway**:

*In Mitochondria:*
- **δ-ALA synthase**: Glycine + Succinyl-CoA → 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
  - Requires pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) as cofactor
  - Regulated by EPO and iron availability
  - Low iron → decreased heme translation

*In Cytoplasm:*
- **ALA dehydrase**: ALA → Porphobilinogen
  - **Inhibited by LEAD**
- Series of reactions → Coproporphyrinogen III

*Return to Mitochondria:*
- Synthesis of Protoporphyrin IX
- **Ferrochelatase (FECH)**: Adds Fe²⁺ to protoporphyrin IX → Heme
  - Can also incorporate zinc into protoporphyrins
  - **Inhibited by LEAD**

**Clinical Relevance**:
- Mutations in ALAS2 can cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia
- Enzyme deficiencies lead to porphyrias
- Lead poisoning inhibits multiple steps, causing anemia and basophilic stippling

### Reticulocytes

**Characteristics**:
- Enucleated erythroid cells with residual RNA
- Slightly larger than mature RBCs
- Bluish tinge on standard staining (polychromasia)
- RNA visible with supravital stains (new methylene blue)

**Normal Values**:
- Newborn: 1.7-7% (220-420 × 10⁹/L)
- 2 weeks-12 years: 0.5-3.0% (25-135 × 10⁹/L)
- Adults: 0.5-2.0% (25-75 × 10⁹/L)

**Clinical Significance**:
- Provides window into bone marrow's response to anemia
- Elevated in hemolytic anemia or blood loss
- Low in bone marrow failure or production problems

## Megakaryocytic Hematopoiesis

### Megakaryocyte Development

**Process**: Endoreduplication (mitosis without cytokinesis)
- Cell size increases dramatically
- Nucleus increases in size and lobation (>2N chromosomal content)
- Cytoplasm becomes increasingly granular

**Duration**: 4-7 days from CFU-MK to platelet release

**Location**: Adjacent to vascular sinuses in bone marrow
- Cytoplasmic projections extend into vessels
- Platelets "pinch off" into circulation

### Platelet Characteristics

**Lifespan**: 7-10 days

**Function**: Primary hemostasis
- Platelet plug formation
- Release of clotting factors and mediators

**Count**: 150,000-450,000 per microliter

### Thrombopoietin (TPO) Regulation

**Primary Growth Factor**: Thrombopoietin
- Acts through MPL receptor
- Other cytokines contribute: IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, GM-CSF, SCF

**Regulation Mechanism**:
- Fixed amount of circulating TPO produced
- In bone marrow: TPO promotes megakaryocyte and platelet production
- In circulation: TPO binds to platelets and is internalized and degraded
- When platelet count decreases → more TPO available → increased production
- This creates a negative feedback loop

**Clinical Significance**:
- Decreased platelet destruction → decreased TPO in marrow → decreased production
- Increased platelet destruction → increased TPO in marrow → increased production
- Megakaryocytes share progenitor with erythroid lineage, explaining reactive thrombocytosis in some anemias

## Granulocytic Hematopoiesis

### Neutrophil Development

**Maturation Sequence**:
1. **Myeloblast**: Large nucleus, minimal cytoplasm
2. **Promyelocyte**: Primary granules appear
3. **Myelocyte**: Secondary granules develop
4. **Metamyelocyte**: Nucleus begins indentation
5. **Band neutrophil**: Horseshoe-shaped nucleus
6. **Segmented neutrophil**: Mature, segmented nucleus (2-5 lobes)

**Proliferating Pool** (3-6 days): Myeloblasts through myelocytes

**Maturation/Storage Pool** (5-7 days): Metamyelocytes through segmented neutrophils
- ~75% of neutrophils stored in bone marrow reserve

**Total Marrow Transit Time**: 8-10 days (compared to 3-5 days for monocytes)

**Production Rate**: Up to 2×10¹¹ neutrophils per day

### Neutrophil Lifespan and Distribution

**Circulation**:
- **Circulating pool**: Flowing with blood
- **Marginating pool**: Adherent to vessel walls (liver, spleen, bone marrow)
- Equilibrium between pools

**Tissue Migration**: 1-5 days in tissues

**Total Peripheral Blood Time**: 6-10 hours

### Growth Factor Regulation

**Primary Factors**:
- **G-CSF**: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
  - Promotes neutrophil production and mobilization
  - Used clinically to treat neutropenia
  - Used to mobilize HSCs for transplantation
- **GM-CSF**: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
  - Promotes both granulocyte and monocyte development

**Supporting Factors**:
- SCF, IL-3 support early progenitors
- IL-17A released by T-cells
- IL-23 from tissue-resident macrophages

**Response to Demand**:
- In times of need, reserve can be rapidly mobilized
- Accelerated maturation
- Fewer cell divisions (may result in left shift)
- Early release of less mature forms (bands, metamyelocytes)

### Bone Marrow Organization

**Spatial Distribution**:
- Granulopoiesis occurs near bony trabeculae
- Cells mature outward toward vascular sinuses
- Mature neutrophils found in interstitium
- Organized microenvironment supports orderly development

**Paracrine Regulation**:
- Marrow stromal cells produce cytokines (IL-1, IL-2)
- Local cell-cell interactions regulate production
- TNF-α promotes differentiation but inhibits proliferation
- Interferons and inhibitors (TGF-β, MIP1) can suppress production

- Results in anemia with basophilic stippling
- Elevated protoporphyrins

### Importance of JAK2
- Critical signaling molecule for EPO and TPO
- Mutations in JAK2 cause myeloproliferative neoplasms
- Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis
