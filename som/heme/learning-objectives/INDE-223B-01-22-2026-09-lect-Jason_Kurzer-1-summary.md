**Lecturer:** Jason Kurzer, M.D., Ph.D.
**Department:** Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine
**Date:** January 22, 2026

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Recognize lymphocyte proliferations, normal and abnormal, and provide a differential diagnosis

**Reactive Lymphocytosis - Infectious Mononucleosis:**
- Primary infection with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)
- EBV infects over 90% of adults worldwide
- Latently infected cells persist for life in resting memory B-cells
- Atypical lymphocytes are predominantly non-infected cytotoxic T-cells that have expanded to react against EBV-infected cells

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Most primary infections in children are asymptomatic
- Adolescents/adults present with classic triad: fever, pharyngitis (with white tonsillar exudate), and cervical adenopathy
- Additional symptoms: fatigue and myalgia
- Symptoms develop over 1-2 weeks, then subside 2-4 weeks later
- Palpable spleen in 50-75% of patients with risk of splenic rupture

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Elevated WBC (10-20 K/uL)
- Atypical lymphocytes on peripheral smear (approximately 20% of lymphocytes)
- These are reactive immunoblasts or "Downey cells" - large cells with abundant cytoplasm, occasional granules, and mature chromatin
- ALT elevated in approximately 75% of patients

**Diagnosis:**
- Heterophile antibody test (monospot) - approximately 90% sensitive and specific
- The test detects antibodies that agglutinate animal red blood cells
- EBV serology can also be used:
  - IgM VCA appears first (acute infection)
  - IgG VCA peaks 2-3 weeks after IgM
  - Past infections show IgG VCA, IgG EBNA1, and no IgM VCA

**Other Causes of Reactive Lymphocytosis:**
- Viral infections: Acute CMV, primary HIV, Coxsackie virus, Adenovirus, Dengue
- Non-viral infections: Bordetella Pertussis, Toxoplasmosis

### 2. Describe the features, diagnosis, and treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

**What is ALL?**
- Malignant neoplasm of B- or T-lineage progenitor cells
- Rapidly fatal without immediate treatment
- Most common malignancy of children
- With modern therapy, approximately 80% of children can be cured; 30-40% of adults are cured

**Epidemiology:**
- Peak incidence between ages 1-5 years
- Median age at diagnosis: 17 years
- Male to female ratio: 1.9:1.6
- More common in Hispanic ethnicity and White race compared to Black or Asian populations

**Pathogenesis:**
- Results from successive genetic hits including predisposing mutations, translocations/mutations that promote self-renewal, block differentiation, and promote proliferation
- Common genetic lesions differ between children and adults:
  - Children: Hyperdiploid, ETV6-RUNX1 (better prognosis)
  - Adults: BCR-ABL (Philadelphia chromosome) and BCR-ABL-like (Ph-like) (worse prognosis)
- Majority of ALL has deletions in B-cell development transcription factors (IKZF1, PAX5, EBF1, ETV6, RUNX1)

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Expansion of leukemic blasts in bone marrow replaces normal hematopoiesis
- Symptoms from bone marrow failure:
  - Decreased RBCs: pallor, lethargy, malaise, fatigue
  - Decreased normal leukocytes: infection risk
  - Decreased platelets: bleeding (petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses, retinal hemorrhages)
- Fevers (from blasts or infection)
- Weight loss, abdominal pain
- Bone and joint pain
- Adenopathy: lymphadenopathy, mediastinal mass (especially T-ALL)
- Neurologic symptoms if CNS involved (5-10% of patients, more common in T-ALL)

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Markedly elevated WBC (can be 160 K/uL or higher)
- Anemia
- Thrombocytopenia
- Peripheral blood smear shows monotonous, immature lymphoid cells (blasts)
- Blasts have high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, round to slightly irregular nuclear contours, fine chromatin, minimal agranular cytoplasm

**Diagnosis:**
- Complete blood count with peripheral smear
- Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy showing >90% marrow replacement by blasts
- Flow cytometry to distinguish ALL from AML and to identify B-ALL vs T-ALL
  - B-lineage antigens: CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a
  - T-lineage antigen: CD3
- Cytogenetics and FISH for prognostic chromosomal abnormalities (especially BCR::ABL)
- Molecular testing for B-cell and T-cell receptor clonality to track minimal residual disease
- Lumbar puncture to evaluate for CNS involvement
- Metabolic panel including LDH and uric acid (risk of tumor lysis syndrome)
- Chest X-ray to evaluate for mediastinal mass

**Complications Leading to Mortality:**
- Tumor lysis syndrome: cell turnover releases cellular contents causing hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia
- Risk of acute renal failure, arrhythmias, seizures, and sudden death
- Infection due to decreased normal leukocytes
- Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia

**Prognostic Factors:**
- Most important: minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy
- Additional factors: high WBC count, increased age
- Poor genetic abnormalities: BCR::ABL, MLL (KMT2A) rearrangements, hypodiploidy
- Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL (Ph-like) associated with poor prognosis

**Treatment:**
Multi-agent chemotherapy lasting 2-3 years:

1. **Induction Phase (4-6 weeks):**
   - Goal: Induce remission
   - 3-5 systemic agents: vincristine, corticosteroid, asparaginase derivative, sometimes anthracycline

2. **CNS Therapy:**
   - Intrathecal chemotherapy with or without cranial radiotherapy
   - CNS is protected space where leukemic cells can escape chemotherapy
   - Addition of CNS-directed therapy has dramatically reduced relapse

3. **Consolidation/Intensification (4-8 weeks):**
   - Goal: Eliminate residual clones
   - Multiple drugs: cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine

4. **Maintenance (at least 2 years):**
   - Goal: Increase chance of long-term remission
   - Typically 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate

**Additional Therapies:**
- Kinase inhibitors (imatinib/dasatinib) for Ph+ ALL
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant with HLA-matched donor
- Immunotherapies:
  - Unconjugated antibodies (Rituximab)
  - Conjugated antibodies (Inotuzumab - anti-CD22 conjugated to calicheamycin)
  - Bispecific T-cell Engager (Blinatumomab - binds CD19 and CD3)
  - CAR-T therapy (anti-CD19 directed T-cells)

**Prognosis:**
- Approximately 90% of children achieve cure
- 30-60% of adults achieve cure
- Highest mortality in patients over 65 years of age

### 3. Describe the features, diagnosis, and treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)

**What is CLL/SLL?**
- Malignant neoplasm of mature B-lymphocytes in blood and bone marrow
- When involving lymph nodes and spleen: "small lymphocytic lymphoma"
- When circulating neoplastic cells reach 5 K/uL: "chronic lymphocytic leukemia"
- Most common leukemia in the Western world (30% of adult leukemia, 25% of all leukemias in North America)
- Cannot cure, but can treat effects of disease

**Epidemiology:**
- Incidence: approximately 5/100,000
- Median age at diagnosis: 71.5 years
- Male to female ratio: 1.3:1
- Incidence increases with advanced age

**Pathogenesis:**
- Arises from mature B-cell (majority from memory B-cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation)
- Heterogeneous genetic lesions including deletions, mutations in B-cell transcription factors
- Common chromosomal abnormalities:
  - Del(13q) - better prognosis
  - Del(17p) and TP53 mutations - worse prognosis, most predictive marker for chemotherapy resistance
- IGHV mutation status:
  - Mutated IGHV - better prognosis
  - Unmutated IGHV - worse prognosis

**Immune Dysfunction:**
CLL causes abnormalities of the immune system leading to:
1. **Infections:**
   - Increased likelihood of hospital admission with infection
   - Gram-positive infections common in early disease
   - Reduced response to immunizations
   - Hypogammaglobulinemia (reduction in polytypic immunoglobulins)

2. **Second malignancies:**
   - Risk twice that of general population
   - Most commonly skin cancers

3. **Autoimmune disorders:**
   - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
   - Immune thrombocytopenia

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Most patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis
- Lymphocytosis found on routine CBC
- When symptomatic:
  - Most common: Fatigue
  - Less common: Lymphadenopathy (discrete, soft, nontender), mild splenomegaly
  - Rare: Skin cancer, shingles, warts (due to immunosuppression)

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Elevated WBC (usually around 30 K/uL) due to increased mature lymphocytes
- Diagnosis requires 5 K/uL or more neoplastic lymphocytes
- Peripheral smear shows small to intermediate-sized lymphocytes with mature chromatin ("soccer ball" pattern with clumped/dark areas)
- Smudge cells (due to decreased cell integrity)
- Depending on stage: anemia and thrombocytopenia may be present

**Diagnosis:**
- Flow cytometry of peripheral blood:
  - Cells express CD19, CD20, CD23, CD5 (typically a T-cell antigen), and CD200
- Genetic testing: IGHV mutation status and FISH for prognostic chromosomal aberrations
- Bone marrow biopsy not necessary for diagnosis

**Staging and Prognosis:**
Two staging systems exist (Rai and Binet):
- Most patients present in Rai Stage 0/I
- Stage increases with tumor burden (lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly) and marrow failure (cytopenias)

**Features associated with better vs worse prognosis:**
- Female = better; male = worse
- Age less than 65 = better; 65 or older = worse
- Stage 0 Rai/Stage A Binet = better; higher stages = worse
- Lymphocyte doubling time greater than 12 months = better; less than 12 months = worse
- B2 microglobulin less than 3.5 mg/L = better; 3.5 mg/L or higher = worse
- Del 13q = better; Del 17p and/or TP53 mutations = worse (most predictive for chemotherapy resistance)
- IGHV mutated = better; unmutated = worse

**Indications for Treatment:**
Treatment is withheld until certain checkpoints are reached:
1. Development of symptoms in Rai Stage 0-II: significant weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, fevers
2. Progressive cytopenias
3. Treatment of cytopenias for Rai Stage III/IV
4. Bulky adenopathy (greater than 10 cm masses)
5. Splenomegaly extending greater than 6 cm below left costal margin
6. Immune cytopenias

**Treatment:**
Typically one of three options depending on presence of Del(17p)/TP53:
- Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (e.g., ibrutinib)
- Venetoclax (inhibits BCL2) with anti-CD20 therapy
- Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (e.g., Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab)

**Prognosis:**
- 88.5% 5-year survival
- Could transform to large cell lymphoma (Richter's Syndrome) or rarely Hodgkin lymphoma

## Morphologic Review

**Distinguishing Lymphocyte Types:**

1. **Reactive Immunoblast (Infectious Mononucleosis/Downey cells):**
   - Large cells with abundant cytoplasm
   - Occasional granules
   - Slightly less mature chromatin but still sufficiently condensed
   - More mature appearing than blasts

2. **Lymphoblast (ALL):**
   - High nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio
   - Fine, granular chromatin
   - Almost no visible cytoplasm
   - When cytoplasm visible, it is usually agranular
   - Monotonous appearance

3. **Mature CLL cells:**
   - Small to intermediate-sized
   - High nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio
   - Mature chromatin with prominent coarse, blocky marks throughout nucleus ("soccer ball" pattern)
   - Smudge cells may be present

4. **Myeloid blasts (AML):**
   - More irregularly shaped nuclear contours than lymphoid blasts
   - More open chromatin
   - More likely to have granules in cytoplasm
   - Auer rods (only in myeloid blasts)

## CLL vs CML Comparison

| Feature | CLL | CML |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Molecular mechanism | Heterogeneous genetic lesions | BCR-ABL |
| Age at onset | 71.5 years | 64 years |
| Symptoms | Often asymptomatic; may have adenopathy | Fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, bone pain, abdominal pain and fullness |
| Physical exam | None or adenopathy | Hepatosplenomegaly |
| Blood counts | Elevated WBC with mature lymphocytosis | Elevated WBC with granulocytes, immature granulocytes, basophilia |
| Treatment | Watch and wait, BTK inhibitor, BCL2 inhibitor, chemotherapy + immunotherapy | Tyrosine kinase inhibitors |
| Outcome | 88.5% 5-year survival; can transform to large cell lymphoma | Improved with TKI; worse for patients over 65 (70% 5-year survival); can transform to acute leukemia |

**Key Distinction:** Both CLL and CML are "chronic" because they lack the maturation arrest seen in acute leukemias. Both produce fully mature/differentiated cells, making them less acutely life-threatening than acute leukemias.

## Summary

This lecture covered three major categories of lymphocyte disorders:

1. **Reactive Lymphocytosis:** Primarily infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV, presenting with the classic triad of fever, pharyngitis, and cervical adenopathy

2. **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia:** A rapidly progressive malignancy of lymphoid progenitors, most common in children, requiring immediate multi-agent chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis

3. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia:** An indolent malignancy of mature B-lymphocytes, most common leukemia in Western adults, often asymptomatic at presentation, associated with immune dysfunction

Understanding the morphologic differences between reactive lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, and mature neoplastic lymphocytes is essential for proper diagnosis and management of these disorders.
