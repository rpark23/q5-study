## Learning Objectives

### 1. Describe the pathophysiologic basis of chronic myeloid neoplasms

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are clonal disorders arising from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells characterized by:

**Common Features:**
- Involvement of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells
- Clonal abnormalities (JAK2 V617F mutation most common)
- Growth factor-independent colony formation in vitro
- Marrow hypercellularity with effective hematopoiesis (unlike MDS)
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis
- Risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage
- Potential evolution to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia

**Molecular Pathogenesis:**

**JAK2 V617F Mutation:**
- Found in 95-98% of polycythemia vera (PV)
- Found in 50-60% of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
- Acquired mutation in multipotent progenitor cells
- Results in constitutively active JAK2 tyrosine kinase
- Causes cytokine-independent signaling through JAK-STAT pathway
- Leads to uncontrolled proliferation and survival of myeloid cells

**CALR Mutations:**
- Found in ~25% of ET and PMF (in JAK2-negative cases)
- Mutant calreticulin activates thrombopoietin receptor (MPL)
- Results in constitutive JAK-STAT signaling
- Leads to megakaryocyte proliferation

**MPL Mutations:**
- Found in ~5% of ET and PMF
- Mutations in thrombopoietin receptor
- Result in cytokine-independent activation

**CML Pathogenesis:**
- BCR::ABL1 fusion gene from t(9;22) Philadelphia chromosome translocation
- Creates fusion protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity
- p210 BCR-ABL in CML, p190 BCR-ABL in Ph+ ALL
- Drives uncontrolled myeloid proliferation
- Can progress through chronic, accelerated, and blast phases

### 2. Describe the clinical presentation of chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis

#### **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Asymptomatic in ~50% of cases (found on routine lab tests)
- 85% diagnosed during chronic phase

**Common Symptoms:**
- Fatigue
- Weight loss/anorexia
- Abdominal fullness (from splenomegaly)
- Night sweats

**Common Signs:**
- Palpable splenomegaly (>50% of patients, can extend to pelvic brim)

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Marked leukocytosis (WBC can exceed 500K/μL)
- Abnormal differential with left shift (myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, blasts)
- Basophilia (characteristic finding)
- Eosinophilia
- Thrombocytosis
- Anemia (often present)

**Clinical Course (pre-TKI era):**
- **Chronic phase:** 5-6 years, <15% blasts
- **Accelerated phase:** 6-9 months, 15-30% blasts
- **Blast crisis:** 3-6 months median survival, >30% blasts

#### **Polycythemia Vera (PV)**

**Diagnosis:**
- Elevated hemoglobin (Hgb >16.5 g/dL men, >16 g/dL women)
- All cell lineages can be elevated (panmyelosis)
- JAK2 V617F mutation (95-98%)
- Subnormal erythropoietin (EPO) level
- Bone marrow biopsy strongly encouraged

**Clinical Manifestations:**
- Constitutional symptoms: weakness, sweating, arthralgias, weight loss
- Neurologic (60-80%): headache, TIA, CVA, dizziness, visual disturbances, paresthesias
- Pruritus (50%), especially after warm bath (aquagenic pruritus)
- Hemorrhage (30-40%)
- Erythromelalgia (burning pain in hands/feet)

**Physical Examination:**
- Ruddy cyanosis (plethoric appearance)
- Conjunctival plethora
- Hepatomegaly
- Splenomegaly
- Hypertension

**Key Concept:** Risk of thrombosis increases exponentially with hematocrit >0.55

#### **Essential Thrombocythemia (ET)**

**Diagnosis:**
- Sustained thrombocytosis (platelets typically >450K/μL)
- JAK2 V617F (50-60%), CALR mutations (~25%), MPL mutations (~5%)
- Must exclude secondary/reactive thrombocytosis

**Peripheral Blood:**
- Thrombocytosis with giant, hypogranular platelet forms
- Mild leukocytosis may be present
- Normal erythrocytes
- Rarely circulating megakaryocyte fragments

**Bone Marrow:**
- Normocellular to hypercellular
- Megakaryocytic hyperplasia with loose clusters
- Abnormal megakaryocytes: abundant cytoplasm, "cloud-like" multilobated nuclei
- No marrow fibrosis

**Clinical Manifestations:**
- Similar to PV: constitutional symptoms, neurologic symptoms, pruritus
- Hemorrhage
- Erythromelalgia
- Thrombosis risk (age >60 and prior thrombosis are major risk factors)

#### **Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)**

**Pathophysiology:**
- Clonal MPN cells elaborate inflammatory cytokines
- Cytokines stimulate reactive fibrosis in marrow
- Leads to extramedullary hematopoiesis
- Progressive phases: pre-fibrotic → overt fibrosis

**Clinical Manifestations:**
- **Massive splenomegaly** (hallmark finding)
- Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats, bone pain, profound fatigue)
- Anemia (often severe)

**Laboratory Findings:**
- **Leukoerythroblastic blood picture:** nucleated RBCs and immature myeloid cells in peripheral blood
- Teardrop cells (dacrocytes)
- Variable WBC and platelet counts
- JAK2 V617F (50-60%), CALR mutations (~25%), MPL mutations (~5%)

**Bone Marrow:**
- Hypercellular with megakaryocyte proliferation
- Progressive reticulin and collagen fibrosis
- Often "dry tap" on aspiration due to fibrosis

**Prognosis:**
- DIPSS Plus scoring system stratifies risk
- Low risk: 185 months median survival (15.4 years)
- Intermediate-1: 78 months (6.5 years)
- Intermediate-2: 35 months (2.9 years)
- High risk: 16 months (1.3 years)

**Risk Factors (IPSS/DIPSS Plus):**
- Age >65
- Hemoglobin <10 g/dL
- WBC >25,000/mm³
- Constitutional symptoms
- Peripheral blood blasts ≥1%
- RBC transfusion dependence
- Platelet count <100,000/mm³
- Unfavorable cytogenetics

### 3. Discuss the biologic basis for treatment strategies used in CML and MPNs

#### **CML Treatment**

**Goals of Therapy:**
- Cure (if possible)
- Elimination of symptoms
- Complete hematologic remission (CHR)
- Complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) - 0% Ph+ cells
- Molecular remission - reduction in BCR::ABL1 transcripts:
  - MMR (Major Molecular Response): ≤0.1% on international scale (IS)
  - DMR (Deep Molecular Response): ≤0.01% IS
  - Very deep molecular response: ≤0.0032% IS
- Avoidance of disease progression
- Treatment-free remission (TFR)

**Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs):**

**Mechanism of Action:**
- TKIs are ATP-mimetic agents
- Bind to ATP-binding pocket of ABL kinase domain
- Prevent ATP binding and substrate phosphorylation
- Block downstream BCR::ABL1 signaling
- Inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis

**Available TKIs:**
- **1st generation:** Imatinib (Gleevec) - FDA approved 2001
- **2nd generation:** Nilotinib, Dasatinib, Bosutinib (all approved for frontline)
- **3rd generation:** Ponatinib (for T315I mutation or multi-TKI failure)
- **Asciminib:** STAMP (Specifically Targeting the ABL Myristoyl Pocket) inhibitor - approved 2024 for frontline

**Long-term Outcomes with Imatinib (10.9 year follow-up):**
- Overall survival: 83.3%
- Complete cytogenetic response: 82.8%
- Major molecular remission: 93%
- Freedom from progression: 93%

**Treatment Response Milestones:**
- 3 months: BCR::ABL1 >10% is warning sign
- 6 months: Should achieve partial cytogenetic response
- 12 months: Should achieve MMR (≤0.1% IS)

**Resistance Mechanisms:**
- Poor compliance (most common)
- BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutations (50% of resistance)
  - T315I "gatekeeper" mutation (20% of mutations, resistant to all TKIs except ponatinib and asciminib)
- BCR::ABL1 gene amplification
- Cellular drug efflux mechanisms

**Novel Approach - Asciminib:**
- Binds to ABL myristoyl binding pocket (not ATP pocket)
- Different mechanism than other TKIs
- In frontline trial (2024): 68% achieved MMR at 48 weeks vs 49% with investigator-selected TKI
- Lower discontinuation rate: 4.5% vs 11.1%

**Treatment-Free Remission:**
- Goal for some patients with sustained deep molecular response
- STIM1 study: 38% remained in remission at 60 months after stopping imatinib
- Most relapses occur within first 6 months (median 2.5 months)
- Late relapses (>18 months) uncommon (5%)

#### **MPN Treatment**

**Polycythemia Vera Treatment:**

**Risk-Adapted Approach:**
- **Low risk** (age ≤60, no thrombosis history):
  - Low-dose aspirin
  - Phlebotomy to maintain Hct <45%
- **High risk** (age >60 or thrombosis history):
  - Low-dose aspirin + phlebotomy
  - Cytoreduction: Hydroxyurea (HU) or Interferon-α
  - Ruxolitinib for HU-resistant/intolerant PV

**Biologic Rationale:**
- Hematocrit control reduces thrombosis risk (exponential increase >0.55)
- Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation
- Cytoreduction reduces cell burden and symptoms
- Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) blocks JAK-STAT signaling

**Ropeginterferon alfa-2b (Besremi):**
- FDA approved 2021
- Long-acting pegylated interferon
- Achieves better molecular responses than hydroxyurea
- 6-year data: reduced thrombosis, myelofibrosis, death compared to hydroxyurea
- Can reduce JAK2 V617F allele burden significantly

**Essential Thrombocythemia Treatment:**

**Risk Stratification (Revised IPSET):**
- **Very low risk:** Age ≤60, no thrombosis, no JAK2 mutation → observation
- **Low risk:** Age ≤60, no thrombosis, JAK2 mutated → ASA 81mg daily
- **Intermediate risk:** Age >60, no thrombosis, no JAK2 mutation → ASA 81mg daily
- **High risk:** Age >60 or prior thrombosis → ASA + cytoreduction

**Cytoreduction Options:**
- Hydroxyurea (first-line)
- Interferon (especially in younger patients, pregnancy)
- Anagrelide (second-line)

**Primary Myelofibrosis Treatment:**

**JAK Inhibitors - Mechanism:**
- Target mutant and wild-type JAK2
- Active regardless of driver mutation (JAK2, CALR, MPL) because all result in activated JAK-STAT signaling
- Block inflammatory cytokine production
- Reduce spleen size and symptoms

**Available JAK Inhibitors:**
1. **Ruxolitinib (Jakafi)** - FDA approved 2011
   - First JAK inhibitor
   - COMFORT-I and -II trials showed ~30% reduction in death hazard at 5 years
2. **Fedratinib (Inrebic)** - FDA approved 2019
   - More selective JAK2 inhibitor
3. **Pacritinib (Vonjo)** - FDA approved 2022
   - For patients with platelets <50,000
   - Spares platelets better
4. **Momelotinib (Ojjaara)** - FDA approved 2023
   - Inhibits JAK1/2 and ACVR1
   - Improves anemia in some patients

**Key Points about JAK Inhibitors:**
- Effective at reducing splenomegaly and MF-related symptoms
- Modest effects on marrow fibrosis or JAK2 allele burden
- On-target effects: anemia and thrombocytopenia (dose-limiting)
- No JAK inhibitor proven to cure MF or definitively alter natural history
- Survival benefit modest but significant

**Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant:**
- Only curative option for MF
- Reserved for intermediate-2 and high-risk patients
- Significant morbidity/mortality risk
- Patient selection critical

**Novel Therapeutic Approaches (2026):**

1. **Mutant CALR-directed therapies:**
   - INCA033989: monoclonal antibody targeting mutant CALR
   - FDA Breakthrough Designation for CALR-mutated ET (2025)
   - Early trials show 76% hematologic response rate
   - 60% achieve durable CHR with VAF reductions

2. **Combination approaches:**
   - JAK inhibitors + agents targeting other pathways
   - Goal: improve symptoms, spleen reduction, blood counts (especially anemia)

3. **V617F mutant-selective JAK2 inhibitors:**
   - In development
   - Would spare normal JAK2 function

4. **Novel agents for anemia:**
   - Major unmet need in MF
   - Momelotinib addresses this partially via ACVR1 inhibition

## Key Concepts Summary

### Differential Diagnosis Considerations

**Polycythemia Vera vs. Secondary Erythrocytosis:**
- PV: Low EPO level, JAK2 mutation, bone marrow hypercellularity
- Secondary: Normal/high EPO level, no JAK2 mutation
- Secondary causes: Hypoxia (lung disease, smoking, high altitude), renal lesions, endocrine tumors, drugs (androgens)

**Essential Thrombocythemia vs. Reactive Thrombocytosis:**
- ET: Clonal, JAK2/CALR/MPL mutations, abnormal megakaryocytes
- Reactive: Normal megakaryocytes, underlying cause identified
- Reactive causes: Inflammation, infection, malignancy, iron deficiency, post-splenectomy

### Thrombosis and Hemorrhage in MPNs

**Thrombosis Risk:**
- Increased blood viscosity (PV)
- Abnormal platelet function
- Endothelial activation
- Sites: Arterial and venous, including unusual sites (Budd-Chiari, portal vein thrombosis)

**Hemorrhage Risk:**
- Extreme thrombocytosis (>1,500K) → acquired von Willebrand syndrome
- Platelet dysfunction
- Aspirin use

### Disease Evolution

**Post-PV/ET Myelofibrosis:**
- Can occur years after PV or ET diagnosis
- Clinical features similar to primary MF
- Treated similarly to primary MF

**Leukemic Transformation:**
- Risk in all MPNs
- Highest in PMF (10-20% at 10 years)
- Lower in PV and ET (<5% at 10-15 years)
- Poor prognosis once transformed

### Genomic Complexity

**High-risk mutations in MF:**
- ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, IDH1/2, U2AF1
- Associated with worse prognosis
- Multiple mutations (mean 13 in PMF vs 6.5 in PV/ET)

## Clinical Pearls

1. **CML is highly treatable:** With TKIs, CML has transformed from a fatal disease to a chronic condition with near-normal life expectancy for most patients.

2. **Monitor for resistance:** Regular molecular monitoring essential to detect treatment failure early.

3. **PV hematocrit target:** Maintain Hct <45% to minimize thrombosis risk.

4. **JAK inhibitors don't cure MPNs:** They provide symptom control and may prolong survival but don't eliminate the malignant clone.

5. **Splenomegaly response predicts benefit:** Patients who achieve spleen reduction with JAK inhibitors have better outcomes.

6. **Anemia is challenging:** Remains a major therapeutic challenge in MF, with few effective options.

7. **Consider transplant early:** For appropriate high-risk MF patients, don't wait too long to refer for transplant evaluation.

8. **New era of targeted therapy:** Mutant CALR antibodies represent a new paradigm in MPN therapy - targeting the neoantigen on the cell surface.
