# Fever of Unknown Origin in Adults

## Article 1: Evaluation and Management

### Introduction

From the perspective of a practicing clinician, an overarching definition of fever of unknown origin (FUO) is fever persisting longer than typical self-limiting conditions (eg, common viral illnesses) in the absence of an identifiable cause despite a reasonable evaluation by an experienced clinician.

### Definitions and Categories of FUO

#### Classic FUO
Proposed definitions for FUO typically have three components:
- Definition of fever
- Duration of fever
- Lack of diagnosis despite reasonable evaluation

#### Health Care-Associated FUO
Patients undergoing or recently exposed to health care are at risk for specific infectious and noninfectious causes of fever. Often divided based on whether the patient is hospitalized in the ICU, hospitalized outside the ICU, or recently underwent surgery.

#### FUO in Immunocompromised Patients
Immunocompromised patients are at risk for a broad range of opportunistic infections. Definitions of immunocompromise include:
- Neutropenia (ANC <500 cells/microL for at least one week within three months prior to start of fever)
- Use of immunosuppressive drugs for solid organ or hematologic stem cell transplant
- Known hypogammaglobulinemia

#### Travel-Associated FUO
Some infections remain latent for years (eg, tuberculosis, melioidosis, endemic mycotic diseases) and may therefore present as fevers remote from the time of travel.

### Initial Evaluation and Management

#### Obtaining a History

**History of Present Illness - Fever History:**
- Patients should be advised to perform actual temperature measurements with a thermometer
- Although rectal temperature is the most accurate, oral or tympanic membrane thermometers are usually adequate

**Associated Symptoms:**
- Document all associated symptoms carefully

**Past Medical History:**
- Prior illnesses and hospitalizations
- Previous diagnoses

**Medications:**
- Review all current medications, especially new ones or those known to cause fevers

**Family History:**
- Genetic conditions that may cause recurrent fevers

**Social History, Including Exposures:**

- **Travel history** - Understanding where patients lived in the past is important as some infections remain latent for years
- **Occupational history, hobbies, and sports** - Work history can reveal exposures that predispose to certain conditions (eg, dentists at increased risk for HIV and bloodborne pathogens, microbiology laboratory workers at risk for numerous pathogens)
- **Outdoor exposures** - Soil (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, leptospirosis), caves (histoplasmosis), natural or flood waters (typhoid/enteric fever, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, melioidosis)
- **Animal exposures** - Pets (cat scratch disease), livestock (brucellosis, Q fever), wild animals (tularemia from rabbits)
- **Insect exposures** - Mosquitoes (malaria), lice, fleas, mites, and ticks
- **Food and drink habits** - Contaminated food/water (typhoid/enteric fever), unpasteurized dairy products (brucellosis)
- **Smoking and drug use history** - Smoking is a risk factor for malignancies; drug use can lead to endocarditis, acute HIV, hepatitis B and C, interstitial lung disease, sinusitis, drug-induced vasculitis
- **Sexual history** - Recent and remote sexual activity, number of contacts, gender, types of activity; STIs that can manifest as FUO include acute HIV, disseminated gonococcus, and pelvic inflammatory disease
- **Recent health care exposure** - Including dental and outpatient care, medical care in other countries

#### Physical Examination

A thorough physical examination is of paramount importance in patients with classic FUO. Every organ system should be evaluated. Thorough examination should include:

- Temporal arteries
- Ophthalmologic examination (including conjunctivae, fundoscopy)
- Oral cavity (palate, teeth, gums)
- Thyroid
- Lymph nodes (neck, supraclavicular, axillae, groin)
- Breast examination
- Lungs
- Heart
- Abdomen (including liver and spleen size, rectal and prostate examination)
- Genitalia (including testes/epididymis and gynecologic pelvic examination in women with pelvic symptoms)
- Neurologic examination (including cranial nerves and cognition)
- Joints and spine
- Skin and nails (including wounds under dressings and casts)

#### Initial Diagnostic Testing

**Basic Tests for All Patients:**
- Complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear
- Complete metabolic panel, including calcium
- Liver biochemical tests (aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin)
- Blood cultures (two sets) from two separate venous sites; incubate for at least five days
- Urinalysis with reflex to urine culture
- HIV antigen/antibody testing with reflex confirmatory testing (add HIV viral load if acute HIV syndrome suspected)
- Antinuclear antibodies
- Rheumatoid factor
- Heterophile antibody test (Monospot) or Epstein-Barr virus antibody tests in young adults
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein
- Ferritin
- Thick and thin blood smears for malaria (especially in endemic areas or with compatible clinical/lab features)
- CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast

---

### Initial Management

#### Fever Diary
Advise all patients with prolonged unexplained fevers to maintain a fever diary including:
- Date, time, height, and duration of fevers
- Heart rate during fevers
- Method of assessment
- Associated symptoms
- Timing and dose of any antipyretic medications

Temperature-pulse dissociation (relative bradycardia) may be a clue for enteric fever, brucellosis, drug fever, and factitious fever.

#### Discontinue Nonessential Medications
Especially new medications or those known to cause fevers. Resolution of fever within two half-lives of the drug (usually within 3-4 days) supports the diagnosis of drug fever.

#### Deciding Whether to Use Antipyretics
- Advise not taking antipyretics during afebrile periods (can mask important features and eliminate ability to monitor fever patterns)
- Once fever occurs, avoid antipyretics unless uncomfortable or have risk factors for complications (seizure, cardiac disease)

#### Limited Role of Empiric Antibiotics and Glucocorticoids

**Empiric Antibiotics:**
- For potentially life-threatening infection: administer empiric antibiotics targeting suspected pathogen
- Otherwise, avoid antibiotics as they can mask/delay diagnosis and interfere with culture results
- Obtain blood and urine cultures prior to starting antibiotics

**Empiric Glucocorticoids:**
- For strongly suspected giant-cell arteritis: begin corticosteroids immediately to prevent complications (permanent visual loss, stroke)
- Planned biopsy should not delay corticosteroids; biopsy results not altered during first month of therapy
- Otherwise, avoid glucocorticoids as they can worsen infections and mask malignancies

---

### Subsequent Evaluation and Management

#### If Fevers Resolve Spontaneously
- Perform no further workup
- Advise patients to return if fevers or other symptoms return
- Discontinue antipyretics to confirm resolution

#### Persistent Fevers
- Serial evaluations, sometimes sequential testing
- Examine patients once weekly for first few weeks in outpatient setting
- Repeat history and examination at follow-up visits
- Review fever diary
- Patients sometimes recall additional information at follow-up

#### Targeted Testing

**Mononucleosis:** Epstein-Barr serology, HIV viral load, CMV serology or PCR, toxoplasma serology

**Infective Endocarditis:** Echocardiogram and blood cultures

**Tuberculosis:** Sputum AFB stains and cultures (plus PCR if available), TST or IGRA tests

**Disseminated Endemic Fungal Infection:** Disease-specific diagnostic tests based on geographic exposure

**Vasculitis:** Laboratory studies and biopsy of affected tissues

#### Role of Biopsy

Commonly biopsied sites in patients with FUO:

- **Temporal artery** - Giant-cell arteritis; biopsy should not delay initiation of corticosteroids
- **Lymph node or unexplained masses** - Suspected malignancy (lymphoma, metastatic cancer) or nonmalignant conditions (tuberculosis, cat scratch disease)
- **Skin** - Less invasive, high diagnostic yield especially for vasculitis; "blind" skin biopsies can diagnose intravascular lymphoma
- **Liver** - Useful when imaging suggests malignant or granulomatous lesions (miliary TB, sarcoidosis, disseminated fungal infection, Q fever, brucellosis)
- **Bone marrow** - Helpful for hematologic malignancy and difficult-to-diagnose infections; highest yield in patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, or other hematologic abnormalities
- **Bowel** - Large bowel biopsy for inflammatory bowel disease; small bowel biopsy for Whipple's disease

#### No Etiology Identified

**Continued Observation:**
- For well-appearing patients, continue serial observations
- Fevers spontaneously resolve in most well-appearing patients
- Consider factitious fever in patients who appear well, have thorough workup, and never have fever documented in clinic

**Whole-Body Imaging:**

*FDG PET/CT Scans:*
- Obtain in patients with unexplained FUO who appear ill or have ongoing concern for serious diagnoses
- Positive scans identify potential causes, localize sites for biopsy, guide management
- Negative results help exclude focal disease and predict spontaneous resolution
- Meta-analysis: sensitivity 84-86%, specificity 52-63%, diagnostic yield at least 50%
- Best for fevers due to neoplasm or infection
- Most common diagnoses in false-negative results: Still's disease, tuberculosis, polymyalgia rheumatica

*Labelled Leukocyte and Gallium Scans:*
- Rarely utilized; PET/CT has better diagnostic utility
- Pooled sensitivity: gallium 60%, labelled leukocyte 33%

**Broad-Range Molecular Testing:**
- Multiplex nucleic amplification tests, 16S rRNA sequencing, whole genome sequencing, metagenomic next-generation sequencing
- Still in early stages for FUO evaluation

**Role of Empiric Treatment:**
- In patients with weeks of evaluation, likelihood of identifying etiology diminishes
- Therapeutic trial of glucocorticoids should not replace relevant biopsies
- Do not initiate corticosteroids until infections and malignancies excluded
- Advise antipyretics for symptomatic relief
- Do not provide empiric antibiotics (low probability of infection, antibiotics have associated risks)

#### Indications for Consultation
- Infectious diseases specialists
- Rheumatologists
- Hematologist/oncologists

### Overview of Causes

The distribution of FUO causes varies by geographic region and has changed over time with newer diagnostic techniques.

---

### Infections (34-39% of FUO cases worldwide)

#### Tuberculosis
- Both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB can cause FUO
- TST or IGRA tests are not perfectly sensitive or specific
- Negative test does not rule out active TB

---

### Epidemiology Notes

#### Changes Over Time
- The epidemiology of infectious diseases changes over time
- Examples: COVID-19 and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales entering new locales via cross-country travel

#### Geographic Variation
- Areas affected by flood: increased risk of waterborne pathogens (enteric fever, leptospirosis)
- Areas affected by drought: may more easily disperse endemic fungal pathogens (Coccidioidomycosis)
- Climate-related human migration can drive susceptible people into areas with endemic disease
