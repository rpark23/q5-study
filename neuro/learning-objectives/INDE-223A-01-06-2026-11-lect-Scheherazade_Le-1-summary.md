# Primary Headaches - Lecture Summary

**Lecturer:** Dr. Scheherazade Le
**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Course:** INDE-223A

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Review SNOOP features for secondary headaches
- **Systemic symptoms or illness**: Fever, rash, vomiting, pregnancy/postpartum, cancer, immunocompromised, anticoagulated, oral contraceptives, family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage
- **Neurologic symptoms or signs**: Focal deficits, altered mental status, seizure, syncope, papilledema, stiff neck
- **Onset**: First or worst, sudden (especially if <5 yo or >40 yo)
- **Other associated conditions**: Head trauma, awakens from sleep, worse with Valsalva/sex/exercise, postural or after lumbar puncture
- **Prior headache history is different**: Worsening pattern, rapidly progressive in severity/frequency

### 2. Describe the major types of primary headaches

#### **Migraine** (Most common primary headache)
**Diagnostic Criteria (memorize):**
- A. At least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D
- B. Headache attacks lasting 4-72 hours, untreated
- C. At least 2 characteristics:
  - Unilateral, pulsating, moderate-severe pain
  - Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activities
- D. At least 1 present during headache:
  - Photophobia AND phonophobia, OR
  - Nausea ± vomiting
- E. Not attributed to any other disorder

**Epidemiology:**
- Prevalence: 12-18% of population
- Females: 17.1%; Males: 5.6%
- Highest incidence in women of childbearing age (20-40 years)
- Peaks in late 30s, declines during 50s
- Lowest among Asians, highest among Caucasians

**Migraine Auras:**
- Precede migraines in 20-30% of migraineurs
- Develop gradually over 4 minutes
- Reversible <60 minutes
- 99% are visual phenomena (zigzag lines/fortification spectra, scotomata)
- Other auras: sensory, language/speech disturbance
- Motor weakness is NOT considered part of aura

#### **Tension-Type Headache (TTH)**
**Characteristics:**
- Location: Usually bilateral
- Quality: Gradually worsening pressure or tightness, band-like
- Intensity: Mild-moderate that waxes and wanes
- Duration: Minutes to days
- Usually worsens late in the day but NOT with activity
- No nausea
- Devoid of migrainous phenomena

**Epidemiology:**
- Lifetime prevalence: 88% women, 69% men
- Onset: Most common during adolescence or young adulthood
- 25% of patients with TTH also have migraine

#### **Cluster Headache** ("Ice pick" headache)
**Characteristics:**
- Location: ALWAYS unilateral during attack, usually behind eye or temple
- Quality: Deep, excruciating, explosive, stabbing pain
- Duration: 15-180 minutes, 1-3 attacks over 6-12 weeks
- Associated symptoms:
  - Ipsilateral tearing, eyelid edema, scleral injection
  - Rhinorrhea, sweating, pallor
  - Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis)
- Restlessness/agitation during attacks
- Exacerbated by alcohol and nitroglycerin

**Epidemiology:**
- Prevalence: 1%, men > women
- Peak onset age 25-50
- More common in smokers and African Americans

### 3. Treatment Approaches for Migraine

#### **Abortive (Acute) Treatment**

| Class | Prototype | Side Effects |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **NSAIDs** | Naproxen, ibuprofen | GI upset, ulcers, medication overuse headache |
| **Triptans (5-HT1B-D agonists)** | Sumatriptan | Chest pain/SOB, serotonin syndrome; CI: ischemic heart disease, HTN |
| **5-HT1F receptor agonist** | Lasmiditan | Dizziness, paresthesias, sedation; no vasoconstriction |
| **Ergots** | DHE (dihydroergotamine) | Rhinitis, drowsiness, dizziness; CI: PVD, CAD |
| **Anti-emetics** | Metoclopramide | Extrapyramidal side effects |
| **CGRP receptor antagonists** | Ubrogepant, rimegepant | Nausea, somnolence, dry mouth |

**Avoid:** Opiates and barbiturates (habit forming, may worsen sensitization)

#### **Prophylactic Treatment**

**Indications for prophylaxis:**
- >4 attacks per month
- Recurring migraine significantly interfering with daily routine despite acute treatment
- Failure/contraindication/troublesome side effects from acute medications
- Medication overuse headache (≥15 days/month)

| Class | Prototype | Side Effects |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Beta-blockers** | Propranolol | Fatigue, depression; CI: asthma |
| **Tricyclic antidepressants** | Amitriptyline, nortriptyline | Anticholinergic: sedation, dry mouth, urinary retention, weight gain |
| **Anti-seizure drugs** | Valproate | Teratogen, hyperandrogenism, weight gain, liver toxicity |
|  | Topiramate | Teratogen (cleft lip/palate), cognitive effects, weight loss |
|  | Gabapentin | Sedation, weight gain |
| **Botulinum toxin** | OnabotulinumtoxinA | Injection site reaction, cosmetic muscle atrophy |
| **CGRP monoclonal antibodies** | Fremanezumab, erenumab, galcanezumab | Injection site reaction, rare abnormal LFTs |
| **CGRP receptor blockers** | Rimegepant, atogepant | Constipation, nausea, upper respiratory infection |

**Prophylaxis Principles:**
- Start low, slowly increase until dose max or side effects
- Give each medication a full therapeutic trial (2-6 months)
- Most prophylactic medications are Class C or D (contraindicated in pregnancy)

### 4. Neuroanatomy Review

#### **Trigeminothalamic Pathway** (analogous to spinothalamic tract for face)
CN V sensory afferents → trigeminal ganglion → brainstem descending spinal tract of V → synapse on spinal nucleus V (medulla) → decussate and ascend as spinothalamic tract → VPM thalamus → primary somatosensory cortex

**In migraine:**
- Activation leads to neurogenic inflammation
- Release of neuropeptides (substance P, CGRP, neurokinin A)
- Causes sensitization with decreased pain thresholds and increased pain magnitude
- CGRP mediates trigeminovascular pain transmission

#### **Pupillary Light Reflex** (Parasympathetic pathway)
- **Afferent:** CN II
- **Efferent:** CN III bilaterally
- Normal response: Bilateral pupillary constriction when light shined in one eye
- **Lesion of parasympathetic pathway** → pupillary dilation
- **Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)** = lesion at eye or optic nerve

#### **Sympathetic Pathway for Pupil Dilation**
Hypothalamus → descends through brainstem → lateral spinal cord to T1/T2 → exits via white rami communicantes → paravertebral sympathetic chain → ascends to superior cervical ganglion along ICA → pupillary dilator muscle, superior tarsal muscle (Muller's), sweat glands

**Horner's syndrome** (SANS lesion):
- Ptosis (eyelid drooping)
- Miosis (constricted pupil)
- Anhidrosis (decreased sweating)

## Pathogenesis

### Migraine
**Current theory:** Hereditary sensory processing disorder
- 60% of migraineurs have positive family history
- 70% if both parents have migraines
- 45% if one parent has migraines
- Genetic component: Decreased modulation of afferent impulses, permitting and augmenting perception of head pain

**Other theories:**
- Vascular hypothesis (vasodilation)
- Inflammatory process (neuropeptide release, increased sensitization)
- Cortical spreading depression (progressive cortical shutdown)
- Spreading oligemia (decreased blood flow → delayed hyperemia)

### Cluster Headache
- Hypothalamic activation with secondary activation of trigeminal-autonomic reflex
- Neurogenic inflammation of cavernous sinus walls injures sympathetic fibers

## Key Management Points

### Migraine Management
1. **Identify and manage triggers:** Headache diary, regularize sleep/diet/exercise
2. **Abortive medications:** More effective if given early
3. **Prophylactic medications:** For frequent attacks or significant interference with daily life

### Tension-Type Headache Management
- OTC medications: NSAIDs, acetaminophen
- Avoid caffeine, butalbital, codeine
- If frequent, consider migraine prophylactic medications (start with TCAs)

### Cluster Headache Management
**Abortive:**
- 100% FiO2 at least 6L via non-rebreather face mask for 20 minutes
- Triptans
- Octreotide 100mcg SQ
- Intranasal DHE

**Prophylaxis (required for duration of cluster attacks):**
- Prednisone: Most effective (21-day taper)
- Verapamil (calcium channel blocker)
- Consider valproate, topiramate, lithium
- Galcanezumab CGRP blocker (FDA approved 2019)

## Important Clinical Pearls

1. **Primary headaches account for 90% of headaches** - migraine is the most common
2. **Neurologic exam is normal 90% of the time** in primary headaches
3. **No labs or neuroimaging needed** if no SNOOP features and classic history for primary headache
4. **Medication overuse headache** occurs ≥15 days/month due to overuse of abortive medications - usually resolves when stopping overuse
5. **Migraine with aura** is associated with slightly increased ischemic stroke risk, especially in women on estrogen-based hormonal therapy >50mcg estrogen
6. **Cluster headaches require MRI brain** to rule out structural abnormalities

## Choosing Wisely Recommendations (American Headache Society)

1. Don't perform neuroimaging in patients with stable headaches meeting migraine criteria
2. Don't perform CT for headache when MRI is available (except emergency settings)
3. Don't recommend surgical deactivation of migraine trigger points outside clinical trials
4. Don't prescribe opioids or butalbital as first-line treatment for recurrent headache disorders
5. Don't recommend prolonged or frequent use of OTC pain medications for headache
