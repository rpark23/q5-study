## Status Epilepticus (SE)

### Definition
Status epilepticus is continuous seizure activity lasting 5 minutes or longer. It is a medical and neurological emergency that requires immediate treatment.

### Key Features
- Continuous seizure activity ≥ 5 minutes
- Can result from failure of seizure termination or initiation of mechanisms leading to prolonged seizures
- Can cause permanent consequences including neuronal death, neuronal injury, alteration of neuronal networks, and irreversible brain injury
- Long-term consequences typically occur after 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity

### Clinical Recognition
The phrase "time is brain" applies to status epilepticus just as it does in acute stroke. The longer status epilepticus continues, the more difficult it becomes to treat and the greater the risk of irreversible brain damage.

## First Aid for Seizures and Status Epilepticus

### General First Aid for Seizures
- A: Airway
- B: Breathing
- C: Circulation
- If continuous seizure greater than 2-5 minutes: call 911 and give benzodiazepine

### Initial Treatment for Status Epilepticus

**Memorize this dose:** Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.1 mg/kg IV, given in 2 mg pushes

For an average 70 kg adult, this equals approximately 7 mg total, divided into 2 mg doses given every 1-2 minutes.

### Additional Management Steps
1. ABCD: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Dextrose
2. Administer IV lorazepam 2 mg (memorize this dose)
3. Draw lab work including anti-seizure medication levels and correct abnormalities
4. If still seizing, administer IV fosphenytoin or IV valproic acid
5. Consider intubation and general anesthesia with propofol or pentobarbital if refractory

### VA Cooperative Study Findings
- Lorazepam is the most effective treatment for terminating status epilepticus (65% success rate)
- Initial treatment fails to stop SE in 1/3 of cases, and second medication is usually unsuccessful
- Lorazepam has longer duration of anti-seizure action and lower risk of seizure recurrence compared to other benzodiazepines
- Early treatment (within 30 minutes) has 80% response rate
- Delayed treatment (after 2 hours) has only 40% success rate with first-line drugs

## Mechanisms of Action of ASMs

Anti-seizure medications suppress seizures by raising a patient's seizure threshold. They work through two main mechanisms:

### 1. Decrease Glutamate Excitation
This decreases excitatory neurotransmission in the brain by:
- Blocking sodium (Na+) channels to prevent action potential propagation
- Blocking L-type calcium (Ca++) channels
- Antagonizing glutamate receptors
- Interfering with vesicular glutamate release (levetiracetam's unique mechanism via SV2A protein binding)

### 2. Increase GABA Inhibition
This enhances inhibitory neurotransmission by:
- Modulating GABAA receptors (benzodiazepines, barbiturates)
- Increasing GABA levels
- Potentiating GABA effects

**Important Note:** Benzodiazepines (like lorazepam) work solely by enhancing GABA inhibition. Most other ASMs have multiple mechanisms of action.

---

## Classification: Narrow vs. Broad Spectrum ASMs

### Narrow Spectrum ASMs
Work for focal (partial) seizures or specific seizure types only. Do NOT use for generalized onset seizures as they may worsen them.

- Phenobarbital
- Phenytoin
- Carbamazepine
- Gabapentin

**Exceptions:**
- IV phenobarbital and IV fosphenytoin can be used in status epilepticus (focal or generalized)
- Ethosuximide works ONLY for generalized absence seizures (narrowest spectrum ASM)

### Broad Spectrum ASMs
Work for all seizure types: both focal and generalized onset seizures.

- Lorazepam (benzodiazepines)
- Valproic acid
- Lamotrigine
- Levetiracetam
- Topiramate

- May not be as effective for generalized myoclonic seizures (can worsen them)
- Metabolism: 90% liver, T1/2 = 24 hours
- Liver enzyme inducers decrease lamotrigine levels
- Valproic acid doubles the dose of lamotrigine (requires slower titration)

**Dosing:** Start 25 mg BID for 2 weeks, then increase by 50 mg daily each week to 200 mg BID. Takes about 2 months to reach therapeutic dose to avoid rash. Even slower titration required if taking valproic acid.

**Side Effects:**
- Initiation rash (5-10% incidence, especially if titrated too quickly)
- Risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (requires slow titration over 2 months)
- Dizziness

## Treatment Considerations in Epilepsy

### When to Treat
Neurologists typically do not treat a first-time isolated unprovoked seizure because:
- Risk of recurrent seizure is less than 60%
- Patient does not meet diagnosis of epilepsy

Once a patient has epilepsy (second unprovoked seizure with recurrence risk greater than 60%), ASMs are usually recommended for seizure prophylaxis.

**Exceptions to treating after first seizure:** Consider treatment after single seizure if patient has:
- Focal seizures
- MRI lesions
- Abnormal EEG
- Known genetic epilepsy syndrome
These patients meet criteria for epilepsy after a single seizure.

### Choosing an Appropriate ASM

The clinician must consider three factors:

**1. Classify seizure type: focal vs. generalized**
- Narrow spectrum medications work for focal seizures only
- Broad spectrum medications work for all seizure types

**2. Consider co-morbidities**
- Headaches: valproic acid, topiramate, gabapentin (but avoid valproic acid and topiramate in childbearing age)
- Neuropathic pain: gabapentin, carbamazepine
- Mood disorders: Use mood stabilizers (valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine) or anxiolytics (gabapentin, benzodiazepines); avoid levetiracetam
- Essential tremor: phenobarbital, primidone
- Pregnancy/childbearing potential: Avoid highly teratogenic ASMs (valproic acid, topiramate, phenobarbital)
- Taking hormonal contraceptives or HAART: Avoid CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, topiramate)
- Elderly: Avoid CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (cause osteoporosis, peripheral neuropathy); avoid agents worsening ataxia (older Na+ channel blockers); avoid cognitive impairing agents (topiramate); consider gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam

**3. Consider side effect profile**

### Treatment Strategy
- Decide whether or not to treat
- Choose suitable medication based on seizure type, co-morbidities, and side effect profile
- Start low and go slow
- Start with monotherapy
- Simplify the regimen
- Encourage adherence
- Monitor selective serum levels
- If failure after first medication, consider second medication
- If failure after two medications, consider epilepsy surgery, devices, or alternate options

## Epilepsy and Pregnancy

### Key Considerations

**Contraception:**
- Avoid medications that interact with oral contraceptives (OCPs) - enzyme inducers lower hormone levels
- CYP3A4 enzyme inducers: phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, topiramate
- Medications with no hormonal interactions: levetiracetam, gabapentin
- Consider non-hormonal copper IUD

**Teratogenicity:**
- ASMs increase birth defect risk from baseline 1-2% to 4-10%
- Avoid highly teratogenic ASMs: valproic acid (highest risk), phenobarbital, topiramate
- Valproic acid causes neural tube defects and 10 IQ point neurodevelopmental loss in children
- Topiramate causes cleft palate/oral defects (12/1000 vs. 1/1000 in general population)

**Management During Pregnancy:**
- Seizure freedom for ≥ 9 months prior to pregnancy is associated with high likelihood (84-92%) of seizure freedom during pregnancy
- Folic acid ≥ 0.4 mg before pregnancy to prevent birth defects (decreases risk 50-70%)
- Follow ASM levels monthly and adjust to maintain pre-pregnancy levels
- Do not stop ASMs during pregnancy - teratogenic medications should be substituted before conception
- Breastfeeding benefits greatly outweigh small theoretical harms of ASMs

**Important:** 50% of pregnancies in the US are unplanned, so teratogenicity and contraceptive strategies should be discussed with all patients of childbearing age before pregnancy.

## Clinical Pearls

### Drug Interactions
- Liver enzyme inducers: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, topiramate
- Liver enzyme inhibitor: valproic acid
- No interactions: gabapentin, levetiracetam

### Common Side Effects
- Weight gain: valproic acid, gabapentin
- Weight loss and kidney stones: topiramate
- CBC abnormalities: carbamazepine, valproic acid
- Rash: lamotrigine (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis); carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine (especially Asians with HLA-B*1502)
- Gingival hyperplasia, osteopenia: phenytoin, phenobarbital
- Mood effects: levetiracetam (20%)

### IV Formulations (used in status epilepticus)
- Phenytoin (use fosphenytoin instead to avoid purple glove syndrome)
- Phenobarbital
- Benzodiazepines (lorazepam)
- Valproic acid
- Levetiracetam

### Clinical Pearl: Na+ Channel Blockers
Older ASMs (Na+ channel blockers) affect the fastest firing neurons first, causing:
- Ataxia and incoordination (cerebellar and propriospinal neurons)
- Diplopia (eye movement neurons)
- Cognitive effects
These effects are especially problematic in the elderly.

## Summary

Anti-seizure medications work by raising the seizure threshold through two main mechanisms: decreasing glutamate excitation or increasing GABA inhibition. Choosing the appropriate ASM requires classifying the seizure type (focal vs. generalized), considering co-morbidities, and understanding side effect profiles. Narrow spectrum ASMs work for focal seizures only, while broad spectrum ASMs work for all seizure types. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment with lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg IV in 2 mg doses). Special consideration must be given to patients of childbearing potential due to teratogenic risks of certain ASMs, particularly valproic acid and topiramate.
