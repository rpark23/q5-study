# Neuroscience Block Overview - Course Introduction

**Lecturer:** Dr. Scheherazade Le, MD
**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Course:** SOM223-A: Neuroscience Block

## Note
This was an introductory/overview lecture with **no learning objectives** and **no testable material**.

## Course Overview

### Course Goals
The course aims to provide a conceptual framework for clinical reasoning in neurology rather than comprehensive coverage of all neurologic diseases. Key objectives include:

- Teaching students how to approach patients with neurologic problems
- Developing pattern recognition skills for major neurologic disease categories
- Learning practical neuroanatomy through case-based learning
- Preparing students for clerkships through integration and synthesis of information

### Course Structure
The course is predominantly case-based and organized around diseases of the:
- **Central Nervous System (CNS):** brain, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, muscle

## Scope of Neuroscience

### Major Disease Categories
Neurologists diagnose, treat, and manage disorders affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems, including:

- **Headaches/Pain:** migraine, tension headache, cluster headache, trigeminal neuralgia
- **Dementia/Memory Disorders:** Alzheimer's disease, CJD, frontotemporal dementia
- **Movement Disorders:** Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, tremor, dystonia, ataxia, chorea
- **Brain Tumors:** primary and secondary
- **Neuro-Infectious Diseases:** meningitis, encephalitis, neurocysticercosis, HSV, coccidioidomycosis, syphilis, West Nile Virus
- **Neuroimmunology:** multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica, transverse myelitis
- **Epilepsy:** seizures and seizure mimickers
- **Cerebrovascular Diseases:** ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, vascular malformations
- **Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury**
- **Neuromuscular Disease:** focal neuropathy (Bell's palsy), polyneuropathy (diabetic, Guillain-Barre syndrome), myopathy, myasthenia gravis, ALS
- **Autonomic Disorders:** orthostasis, painful neuropathy, sweating disorders

### Related Subspecialties

## Epidemiology of Neurologic Disease

### Global Burden
- Neurologic disorders account for 6.3% of the global burden of disease
- Eight out of ten disorders in the three highest disability classes are neurologic

### Most Common Neurologic Disorders
In order of prevalence: stroke > dementia > headache > seizures/epilepsy

### US Mortality and Morbidity (2023)
- **Mortality:** Overwhelmingly driven by cerebrovascular diseases (stroke)
  - Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the US
  - Alzheimer's dementia is the 6th leading cause
  - 5.4 million Americans currently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease
  - Projected to reach 16 million by 2050

- **Morbidity:** Predominantly from strokes, but also dementias, migraines, and epilepsy

## Debunking Neuroscience Myths

### Myth 1: "It is too difficult - neurophobia"
**Reality:** Neurology is systematic with the same clinical approach for every patient. While no one can know everything, this is true for all medical specialties.

### Myth 2: "Diagnose, then adios"
**Reality:** Neurologists not only excel at localization but also offer extensive treatments to improve quality of life.

### Myth 3: "You can't help people or save lives"
**Reality:** Neuroscience is not purely academic - there are many opportunities to build long-term relationships with patients and make a meaningful impact.

### Myth 4: "There will be no jobs"
**Reality:** The supply of neurologists has fallen 20% below demand - more physicians are needed in neurology.

### Myth 5: "There are no advances"
**Reality:** New medications, treatments, procedures, and research advances emerge daily in neuroscience.

## Recent Neuroscience Breakthroughs

### Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
Previously a uniformly lethal neuromuscular genetic disease in infants, now treatable with:
- **Nusinersen:** Anti-sense oligonucleotide (intrathecal) modifying SMN2 gene splicing
- **Onasemnogene abeparvovec:** One-time IV or intrathecal gene replacement therapy (approved Dec 2025)
- **Risdiplam:** Daily oral SMN2-directed RNA splicing modifier

These treatments have transformed a deadly disease into a manageable condition.

### Other Major Advances
- **Multiple Sclerosis:** From 3 treatments to over 20 FDA-approved medications
- **Stroke:** DAWN trial extended thrombectomy window from 6 to 24 hours after symptom onset
- **Migraine:** Two entirely new classes of medications approved
- **Alzheimer's Disease:** First disease-modifying medications (aducanumab, lecanemab) approved, though controversial
- **Epilepsy:** New surgical options showing dramatic benefit in children
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces:** Brain-controlled typing for paralysis, robotic arms with sensory feedback

## Key Takeaway

Neuroscience is a dynamic, intellectually stimulating field with rapid therapeutic advances. The course emphasizes systematic clinical reasoning and practical application rather than memorization of exhaustive details. Students are encouraged to adopt the mindset of a neurologist and explore whether this specialty inspires them.
