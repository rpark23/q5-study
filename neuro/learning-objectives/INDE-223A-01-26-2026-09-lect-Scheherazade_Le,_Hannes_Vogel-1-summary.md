## Stroke Overview

### Epidemiology
Stroke is the most common neurological disease and accounts for the majority of neurologic morbidity and mortality in the US. In 2022, stroke was the 5th leading cause of death in the US. Death rates from cerebrovascular disease have been decreasing, representing one of the top 10 public health achievements. However, the declines are not equivalent across different racial groups.

### Why Study Stroke?
- Most common neurological disease
- Major cause of morbidity and mortality
- Good exercise to learn clinically relevant neuroanatomy
- Systematic approach applies to all neurologic diagnoses

---

## Approach to Neurologic Diagnosis

The three-step approach should be applied to all clinical cases:

1. **Formulate key symptoms and signs; establish a time course**
   - Acute onset (seconds to minutes) is characteristic of stroke
   - Ask: What were you doing at the time? Did symptoms occur suddenly or gradually?

2. **Anatomical localization**
   - Where on the y-axis? (CNS vs. PNS; if CNS: cortex, subcortical, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord)
   - Where on the x-axis? (Left, right, midline, diffuse, symmetric/asymmetric)

3. **Etiological diagnosis: What is it?**
   - Use "I MIND THE VIP" mnemonic: Infection, Metabolic, Inflammatory, Neoplastic, Degenerative, Traumatic/Toxic, Hereditary/developmental, Epileptic/Endocrine, Vascular, Iatrogenic, Psychiatric

## Cerebrovascular Anatomy

### Anterior vs. Posterior Circulation

**Anterior Circulation:**
- Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)
- Ophthalmic artery (first branch of ICA)
- Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)
- Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA)
- Anterior Communicating Artery (AComm)

**Posterior Circulation:**
- Vertebral Arteries (VA)
- Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)
- Basilar Artery
- Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA)
- Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA)
- Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA)
- Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm)

### Circle of Willis
The anterior and posterior circulation join to form the Circle of Willis at the base of the brain. Common sites for aneurysms are at branch points of large vessels. Students should be able to draw the Circle of Willis from memory.

### Vascular Territories
- **MCA:** Supplies most of the lateral neocortex, including hand and face areas of motor cortex and language centers
- **ACA:** Supplies medial aspects of hemispheres, including leg areas of motor cortex
- **PCA:** Supplies occipital cortex (primary visual cortex), mesial temporal lobes (hippocampus), and most of thalamus

---

## Localizing Stroke Symptoms

### Cortical Signs (The "A's")
Suggest anterior circulation, cortical involvement:
- Aphasia (language problems - Broca's or Wernicke's)
- Anopsia (visual field defects, e.g., hemianopsia)
- Agnosia (neglect, prosopagnosia)
- Apraxia (inability to follow motor commands)
- Amnesia
- Alexia, Agraphia, Acalculia

### Brainstem/Cerebellar Signs (The "D's")
Suggest posterior circulation, posterior fossa involvement:
- Diplopia (double vision from CN palsies)
- Dysphagia (swallowing difficulty)
- Dysequilibrium (balance problems)
- Dyscoordination/Dysmetria (cerebellar signs)
- Dysconjugate gaze
- Cranial nerve palsies
- "Crossed signs" (ipsilateral face + contralateral body)

### Symptoms That Can Be Either
- Hemianopsia (can be anterior or posterior, but posterior more common)
- Dysarthria (slurred speech - NOT localizing; can be CNS or PNS)
- Dizziness (non-specific)

### Anterior Circulation Only
- Amaurosis fugax (curtain over vision in one eye from ophthalmic artery ischemia)
- Aphasia (especially MCA territory)

### Posterior Circulation Only
- Bilateral blindness (bilateral PCA territory)
- Diplopia (brainstem CN III, IV, VI involvement)
- Vertigo (central - vestibular nuclei, cerebellum)
- Cerebellar signs (ataxia)
- Alternating plegia/sensory (crossed signs)
- Cranial nerve signs (direct brainstem involvement)

---

## Key Stroke Syndromes

### Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Stroke
Most common anterior circulation stroke. Typical presentation:
- Contralateral face and arm weakness > leg (pyramidal pattern: flexors stronger than extensors)
- Contralateral sensory loss (face and arm > leg)
- Contralateral visual field cut (homonymous hemianopsia)
- If left MCA: Aphasia (Broca's if anterior division, Wernicke's if posterior division)
- If right MCA: Neglect
- Gaze deviation toward the lesion (eyes look toward the stroke)

### Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) Stroke
- Contralateral leg weakness and sensory loss > arm/face
- May have urinary incontinence
- If bilateral: abulia (lack of motivation)

### Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) Stroke
- Contralateral homonymous hemianopsia (macular sparing possible)
- If bilateral: cortical blindness
- If left PCA: alexia without agraphia (can write but cannot read)
- Memory impairment if hippocampus involved

### Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenberg's)
Common brainstem stroke from PICA or vertebral artery occlusion:
- Ipsilateral: facial pain/temperature loss, Horner's syndrome, ataxia, dysphagia, hoarseness
- Contralateral: body pain/temperature loss
- Vertigo, nystagmus, nausea

---

## Upper Motor Neuron vs. Lower Motor Neuron Facial Weakness

### UMN Facial Weakness ("Forehead Sparing")
- Lesion of contralateral primary motor cortex or corticobulbar tracts
- Lower 2/3 of face weak contralateral to brain lesion
- Forehead (frontalis) and eye closure (orbicularis oculi) SPARED because of bilateral UMN innervation
- Most common cause: stroke

### LMN Facial Weakness (Forehead Involved)
- Lesion of ipsilateral CN VII (or CN VII nucleus, or facial muscles)
- Entire half of face weak ipsilateral to lesion
- Cannot raise eyebrow, close eye weakly
- Associated peripheral symptoms: taste loss (anterior 2/3 tongue), hyperacusis
- Most common cause: Bell's palsy

---

## Types of Stroke

### Ischemic Stroke (80%)
Results from reduction in oxygen delivery due to arterial occlusion:
- **Thrombotic:** In situ clot formation, often from atherosclerosis at branch points (carotid bifurcation, MCA origin, basilar artery ends)
- **Embolic:** Travel of clot from distant source (cardiac mural thrombi, atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, atherosclerotic plaques in carotid)
- **Lacunar:** Small deep subcortical infarcts from small vessel disease, often hypertensive; produces pure motor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, ataxia-hemiparesis, or dysarthria-clumsy hand syndromes
- **Watershed (border zone):** Decreased brain perfusion in border zones between arterial territories, typically after hypotensive episodes

### Hemorrhagic Stroke (20%)
Must rule out hemorrhage before giving thrombolytics.

**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH):**
- Blood in subarachnoid space
- Classic presentation: sudden "worst headache of life" (thunderclap headache), often with collapse
- Most commonly from ruptured berry aneurysm (90% in anterior circulation at branch points)
- Complications: rebleeding, vasospasm (days 3-10), hydrocephalus
- Diagnosis: Head CT (92% sensitive), if negative must do LP for xanthochromia
- Treatment: secure aneurysm (surgical clipping or endovascular coiling)
- Prognosis: 1/3 die before reaching ER, 1/3 significant morbidity, 1/3 good recovery

**Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH):**

*Primary ICH:*
- Hypertensive hemorrhage: Deep structures (basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, cerebellum); from rupture of microaneurysms on small penetrating arteries
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA): Lobar hemorrhages at gray-white junction; seen in older adults, often with cognitive dysfunction; associated with Alzheimer's disease

*Secondary ICH:*
- From underlying lesion: tumor, infection, vascular malformation (AVM, cavernous malformation), venous thrombosis, conversion of ischemic stroke, trauma, coagulopathy

## Stroke Risk Factors

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors
- Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), prior stroke, or heart disease
- Age: Risk doubles each decade over 55 years
- Sex: Male > female
- Black Americans (mainly due to social drivers/determinants of health, not genetics)
- Family history of stroke

### Modifiable Risk Factors
- Hypertension (most important modifiable risk factor)
- Smoking
- Diabetes mellitus
- High cholesterol (elevated LDL)
- Atrial fibrillation
- Obesity
- Insufficient exercise
- Increased blood viscosity
- Stimulant drug abuse or IVDU

---

## Social Drivers/Determinants of Health (SDOH) in Stroke

### Disparities in Black Americans
- Black Americans have 45% higher stroke mortality than non-Hispanic Whites
- More at risk for uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes
- Less likely to receive acute stroke treatment
- Twice as likely to die from stroke
- Achieve poorer functional outcomes after stroke
- Approximately 60% of disparity in stroke incidence related to SDOH

### Historical Context
SDOH among Black Americans stem from slavery, Jim Crow laws, and structural racism:
- Constitutional Conventions (1787): enslaved Blacks counted as 3/5 of a person
- Jim Crow Laws: institutionalized disadvantages under "separate but equal" guise
- Redlining: discriminatory practice denying financial services to certain areas based on race, leading to decreased property values, reduced quality of schools and healthcare access
- Flexner report (1910): closed all but 2 Black medical schools
- Tuskegee syphilis experiments (1932-1972): unethical experiments without informed consent
- Legacy continues despite Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965)

### SDOH Components
Where we live, learn, work, and play:
- Physical infrastructure: environment, crime, housing, food access, transportation
- Economic factors: employment, poverty, income
- Education: access to school, health literacy
- Social context: segregation, living conditions, community trust/mistrust of medical system
- Healthcare context: access, quality, insurance, health behaviors

### Evidence
Zip code is more of a risk factor than genetic code. A randomized social experiment (Move to Opportunity Study) showed that Black and Hispanic women who moved from high-poverty to low-poverty housing had:
- 50% reduction in likelihood of diabetes
- 40% reduction in extreme obesity
- Positive effects on happiness and well-being
- Increased college attendance in children who moved before age 13

## Acute Stroke Management

### Initial Management
"Time is brain" - stroke is a medical emergency.
1. Secure ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation)
2. Call STROKE CODE
3. Determine last time patient was seen normal
4. STAT neurology assessment with NIHSS (NIH Stroke Scale)
5. Labs: CBC, coagulation panel (PT, PTT, INR), CMP
6. Head CT to distinguish ischemic vs. hemorrhagic stroke (cannot be distinguished clinically)

### Ischemic Stroke Treatment
**Thrombolysis:**
- IV tPA (tissue plasminogen activator = alteplase) or tenecteplase (TNK) if within 4.5 hours and no contraindications
- Earlier treatment = better outcomes
- Risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage: 6.4%
- Contraindications: hemorrhage on CT, INR > 1.7, recent surgery, bleeding disorder

**Endovascular Treatment:**
- Mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion
- Window extended up to 24 hours after symptom onset (DAWN trial)
- Catheter inserted through femoral artery, threaded to intracranial vessels
- Mechanical clot retrieval or intra-arterial tPA

**Supportive Care:**
- Antiplatelet therapy (within 48 hours, wait 24 hours if received thrombolytics)
- NO heparin for acute stroke
- Blood pressure: "permissive hypertension" (let it run high, no Class I evidence for aggressive lowering)
- Avoid hyperglycemia (> 200 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia
- Admit for monitoring, management, workup, rehabilitation

### Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment
- NOT a candidate for thrombolysis or endovascular therapy
- Find and treat underlying cause
- Blood pressure control
- Manage increased intracranial pressure (ICP): hyperventilation, hypertonic saline, mannitol, EVD (external ventricular drain) for CSF drainage
- Surgery rarely indicated unless cerebellar hemorrhage or superficial hemorrhage with mass effect

---

## Secondary Stroke Prevention

### Medications
- Antiplatelet agents: ASA (aspirin) or ASA/ER-dipyridamole (Aggrenox) or clopidogrel (Plavix)
- Anticoagulation for specific indications: atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve, very low ejection fraction (warfarin or NOACs - novel oral anticoagulants)
- Blood pressure control
- Diabetes control
- Statins for hyperlipidemia (LDL goal < 70)

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Increase exercise
- Mediterranean diet
- Smoking cessation

### Address SDOH
Explore social drivers/determinants of health that may increase stroke risk.

### Procedural Interventions
- Carotid endarterectomy or stenting for internal carotid artery stenosis > 70% on symptomatic side
- Assess for carotid bruit (whooshing noise over vessel) - indicates vascular disease risk but not specific for stenosis

---

## Neuropathology of Cerebrovascular Disease

### Brain Metabolism
- Brain is 2% of body weight but accounts for 20% of oxygen consumption
- Receives 15% of cardiac output
- Energy derived from oxidative metabolism of glucose
- No stored energy: immediate consequences from cessation of blood flow or oxygen

### Selective Vulnerability to Hypoxia-Ischemia
In decreasing order of vulnerability:
1. Hippocampus (CA1/Sommer's sector)
2. Cerebral cortex (layers III and V)
3. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
4. Thalamus
5. Basal ganglia
6. Brainstem
7. Hypothalamus
8. Spinal cord

The pattern is different in young infants.

### Hippocampal Changes
CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) in the hippocampus is selectively vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia. Neurons in CA1 are rich in glutamate receptors. With global hypoxia-ischemia, astrocytes cannot adequately re-uptake excitotoxic glutamate, leaving CA1 neurons vulnerable to excitotoxic death.

Microscopy shows "red dead" hypereosinophilic neurons with pyknotic nuclei in CA1, evident 6-12 hours after an irreversible hypoxic/ischemic insult.

### Mechanisms of Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury
- Inappropriate release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate)
- Excessive calcium influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors
- Triggers inappropriate activation of signaling cascades, free radical generation, mitochondrial injury
- Results in cell death, mostly through necrosis
- "Penumbra" (at-risk tissue between necrotic and normal brain) may be rescued with anti-apoptotic interventions

### Timeline of Cerebral Infarction

**Gross Pathology:**
- 0-8 hours: No detectable abnormalities
- 12-36 hours: Blurring of gray-white interface, discoloration of gray matter, slight softening
- Subacute (~5-30 days): Worsening edema (worst around day 3)
- Chronic: Liquefactive necrosis and cavitation at rate of 1 cc/month

**Microscopic Changes:**
- 12 hours: Cellular degeneration, blunting of grey/white junction
- 24 hours: Necrosis and edema
- 72 hours: Neutrophilic infiltrate (first responders)
- 7 days: Macrophages (phagocytosis)
- 14 days: Gliosis (reactive astrocytosis) begins
- 1-6 months: Cystic degeneration with macrophages persisting

### Border Zone (Watershed) Infarcts
- Occur in regions at the most distal reaches of arterial blood supply
- Border zones between arterial territories (e.g., between ACA and MCA)
- Usually seen after hypotensive episodes
- Produces sickle-shaped band of necrosis over cerebral convexity
- Superficial brain may be protected by collateral leptomeningeal vessels

### Laminar Necrosis
In cerebral neocortex after ischemic injury, neuronal loss may be uneven, with preservation of some layers and destruction of others, producing laminar necrosis. This occurs when very superficial areas are preserved due to cortical-leptomeningeal anastomoses.

---

## Embolic and Vasculitic Causes

### Embolic Sources
- Cardiac mural thrombi (MI, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation)
- Thromboemboli from atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries
- Paradoxical emboli (e.g., children with cardiac anomalies)
- Emboli from cardiac surgery
- Other material: tumor, fat, air
- MCA distribution most frequently affected
- Fat embolism after fractures: widespread hemorrhagic lesions in white matter

### Vasculitis
- Infectious vasculitis: tuberculosis, aspergillosis, CMV (especially in immunosuppression)
- Bacterial arteritis: can cause mycotic aneurysm
- Non-infectious: polyarteritis nodosa, SLE, primary angiitis of CNS
- Tuberculous meningitis: causes endarteritis obliterans, leading to infarctions in deep gray matter and brainstem

### Other Causes
- Hypercoagulable states (sickle cell disease)
- Dissecting aneurysm of extracranial arteries

---

## Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage

### Two Principal Causes

**1. Hypertensive Hemorrhage**
- Affects small penetrating arteries
- Loss of elasticity from chronic hypertension, vessels become tortuous, prone to thrombosis
- Microaneurysms in basal ganglia (lenticulostriate arteries), subcortical white matter, pons, cerebellum
- Common locations:
  - Putamen, globus pallidus (may extend into ventricles)
  - Thalamus (may extend into midbrain)
  - Pons and deep cerebellum (usually fatal)

**2. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)**
- Second most common cause (10-15% of cases)
- Associated with Alzheimer's disease, NOT systemic amyloidosis
- Hemorrhages almost always supratentorial, superficial cortical or subcortical
- Frequently ruptures into subarachnoid space (vs. hypertensive ICH which ruptures into ventricles)
- ε2 or ε4 allele increases risk of repeat bleeding
- MRI may show multiple microbleeds at gray-white junctions

### Hypertensive Complications
1. Lacunar infarcts
2. Slit hemorrhages
3. Hypertensive encephalopathy
4. Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage

### Lacunar Infarcts
- Small, cavitary infarcts < 15 mm wide
- "Lake-like" spaces in lenticular nucleus, thalamus, internal capsule, deep white matter, caudate, pons
- Can be clinically silent or cause severe neurologic impairment
- Five classical syndromes: pure motor (F=A=L), pure sensory, sensorimotor, ataxia-hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand

---

## Venous Infarcts

### Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis
- Often very hemorrhagic
- Causes venous congestion and secondary ICH
- Risk factors: dehydration, hyperviscosity, oral contraceptives (high estrogen), pregnancy, malignancy, infection, obesity, genetic prothrombotic states
- Demographics: young women
- Treatment: heparin acutely to prevent thrombus propagation
- Overall better outcomes than arterial strokes

---

## Berry Aneurysms

### Epidemiology and Pathogenesis
- Found in about 2% of population
- Most frequent cause of clinically significant SAH
- 90% occur in anterior circulation near major arterial branch points
- 20-30% have multiple aneurysms
- Develop over time from underlying defect in vessel media

### Risk Factors
Hereditary:
- First-degree relatives of those affected
- Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV
- Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
- Marfan syndrome
- Fibromuscular dysplasia
- Coarctation of aorta

Acquired:
- Cigarette smoking
- Hypertension (~50% of patients)

### Microscopy
At the aneurysm neck, the muscular wall and internal elastic lamina stop short and are absent from the aneurysm sac itself. The aneurysm has no internal elastica or smooth muscle (defining features of arteries).

### Complications
Acute: Ischemic injury from vasospasm involving major vessels of circle of Willis (typically days 3-10 after rupture)

Chronic: Meningeal fibrosis and scarring, sometimes leading to obstruction of CSF flow and interruption of normal CSF resorption pathways (communicating hydrocephalus)

### Other Aneurysm Types
- Atherosclerotic (fusiform; mostly basilar artery)
- Mycotic (from septic emboli, more distal MCA branches)
- Traumatic
- Dissecting

These other types more often cause cerebral infarction rather than SAH.

---

## Vascular Malformations

### Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs)
- Tortuous vascular masses in subarachnoid space or brain parenchyma
- Made of "arterialized" veins (hybrid vessels with abnormal or incomplete elastica)
- Males affected twice as frequently as females
- Usually recognized age 10-30 years
- Presentation: seizure disorder, intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Most common site: MCA territory
- Microscopy: enlarged vessels separated by gliotic tissue, evidence of prior hemorrhage
- Amenable to surgical resection

### Cavernous Hemangiomas (Cavernous Malformations)
- Large, closely packed thin-walled channels with no intervening neural tissue
- Composed of back-to-back vessels (elastica stain negative, distinguishing from AVMs)
- May result in recurrent hemorrhages (subarachnoid or parenchymal) and focal seizures
- Familial forms relatively common (autosomal dominant with high penetrance)
- Multiplicity of lesions is hallmark of familial forms
- Amenable to surgical resection

### Other Malformations
- Capillary telangiectasias: no clinical importance
- Venous angiomas

---

## Circle of Willis Anatomy

### Complete Circle Structure
The circle of Willis is complete and symmetrical in only 1/3 of individuals. It ideally provides collateral blood flow if a segment or entry carotid/vertebral artery is occluded.

### Fetal Configuration
Some individuals retain major blood flow to the posterior cerebral artery from the anterior circulation (fetal posterior communicating artery), representing a normal anatomic variation.

### Clinical Importance
The potential intravascular space in the brain is greater than the available intracranial space, emphasizing the importance of understanding collateral circulation.

---

## Autoregulation and Blood Pressure

Blood supply to the brain is subject to autoregulation over a range of blood pressures. The autoregulation curve shifts with chronic hypertension, changing the breakdown and breakthrough points.

If severely elevated hypertension is rapidly corrected, the shift in the autoregulation curve predicts the possibility of poor perfusion, especially in border zones between arterial perfusion zones.

Regions of the brain at risk for poor perfusion in hypotension are called border or watershed zones.

---

## Special Stroke Entities

### CADASIL
Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy:
- Rare hereditary form of stroke
- Mutations in NOTCH3 receptor gene
- Recurrent strokes (usually infarcts, less often hemorrhages) and dementia
- Concentric thickening of media and adventitia in white matter and leptomeningeal arteries
- Can be diagnosed by skin biopsy or genetic testing

### Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
- Defined as stroke with symptoms lasting < 24 hours (most < 1 hour in practice)
- Often called "mini-stroke"
- Risk factor for larger stroke: 2-17% risk of stroke within 90 days
- DWI MRI often negative

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Stroke is a medical emergency - "time is brain"
2. Strokes within particular vascular distributions have characteristic symptoms and signs
3. Always localize: anterior vs. posterior circulation
4. Must distinguish ischemic vs. hemorrhagic stroke with head CT before treatment
5. Acute treatment options: thrombolysis (within 4.5 hours) and endovascular therapy (up to 24 hours)
6. "Worst headache of life" = assess for SAH with CT head +/- LP
7. Aneurysms can be treated surgically (clipping) or endovascularly (coiling)
8. Secondary prevention: antiplatelet agents, risk factor modification, address SDOH
9. Black Americans have higher stroke risk due to SDOH from structural racism, not genetics
10. Two principal causes of primary ICH: hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy
11. Differentiate UMN (forehead sparing) vs. LMN (forehead involved) facial weakness
12. Review key neuroanatomy: sensorimotor homunculus, visual pathways, extraocular muscles, motor and sensory tracts
