## Learning Objectives

### 1. Define myelin in the CNS, including its function and composition

Myelin is a lipid-rich membrane that ensheaths axons in the CNS and PNS. Large axons (greater than 1-2 micrometers) are myelinated, while smaller axons remain unmyelinated. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes wrap their processes around multiple axons in spiral fashion, with the apposed inner and outer membranes fusing to form compact sheaths. A single oligodendrocyte can myelinate multiple axons, unlike Schwann cells in the PNS which myelinate only one axon each.

Myelin serves two critical functions: it acts as an "electric insulator" enabling saltatory conduction, and as a "nurturer of the axon" providing adhesion and signal transduction. Because myelin is not just structural, demyelination results in both conduction slowing and axon loss due to disruption of myelin-axon interactions. CNS myelination is nearly complete by the end of the second year of life, and myelin proteins appear relatively stable throughout life.

### 2. Discuss the physiological consequences of primary demyelination, secondary demyelination, and the underlying pathology of MS

**Primary demyelination** occurs when myelin is stripped from axons by macrophages, leaving axons relatively intact. Examples include MS, leukodystrophies, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The physiological consequences include slowed saltatory conduction, increased vulnerability of axons to further damage, and eventual axon degeneration. While many axons survive and can undergo remyelination in autoimmune conditions, the process results in immediate impaired axonal conduction and chronic axon injury and loss.

**Secondary demyelination** occurs when myelin is lost due to destruction of axons from other causes, such as infarct, trauma, or degenerative processes (Wallerian degeneration). Without an axon to surround, the myelin degenerates.

**MS pathology** involves immune-mediated inflammation directed against CNS myelin. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier, are reactivated in the perivascular space, and initiate an inflammatory cascade. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells infiltrate acute lesions. B cells and plasma cells act as antigen-presenting cells and produce proinflammatory cytokines and antibodies (including oligoclonal bands). Macrophages and microglia destroy myelin through phagocytosis and complement-mediated damage. Acute lesions show inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells), demyelination (macrophages), activated CNS resident cells, and some axonal injury. Chronic lesions develop gliosis (scarring), with depletion of oligodendrocytes and axon loss.

### 3. Describe the epidemiology of and risk factors for developing multiple sclerosis

MS affects nearly 1 million people in the US, with a risk of 0.1% (1 in 750) in the general population. It is one of the most common neurologic disorders in young adults, typically diagnosed between ages 20-50.

**Sex:** MS has a 3-4:1 female to male ratio. Disease activity decreases during 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy but increases postpartum. Sex hormones, corticosteroids, and cytokines can modulate immune events.

**Race and ethnicity:** Historically described as a "Caucasian disease," but this reflects historical bias in research. Recent data shows nearly equal incidence in Black/African American and White/Caucasian populations, with lower incidence in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander populations. Patients identifying as Black may have higher mortality in younger age groups and more severe disease courses.

**Risk factors:**
- **Vitamin D deficiency:** Low vitamin D increases MS risk. Supplementation decreases risk of developing MS and correlates with decreased disease activity on MRI. Genetic variations in the vitamin D receptor with loss of function increase MS risk.
- **Genetics:** No Mendelian inheritance pattern. 236 independent genetic variations are associated with increased MS risk, most implicating immune system genes. Risk increases with family history: general population 1/1000, parent with MS 1/50 to 1/100, sibling 1/20 to 1/50, identical twin 1/3. All known genetic variants explain only 20-30% of heritability.
- **Geography:** Greater distance from the equator correlates with higher MS prevalence, overlapping with vitamin D levels.
- **Infection:** Nearly 100% of MS patients are EBV-positive (compared to 83-90% of general adults), with higher antibody levels. History of clinical EBV infection nearly doubles MS risk.
- **Smoking and obesity:** Both increase risk through low-grade proinflammatory states.

### 4. Describe most common clinical course of multiple sclerosis and localize the most common symptoms

**Clinical course:** 85% of MS presents as Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), characterized by distinct flares/relapses of neurologic symptoms with recovery in between. Symptoms develop over hours to 1-2 days and resolve over weeks to months. Recovery is often complete early in disease, but residual symptoms become more common later. Historically, 80% of untreated patients progressed to Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) within 20 years. With current treatments, only 15-20% of treated patients convert within approximately 20 years. SPMS involves continued functional loss between flares with fewer flares occurring.

**Localization:** MS affects CNS myelin in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and optic nerves.

**Common symptoms by location:**
- **Cerebral hemispheres:** Unilateral numbness, weakness, spasticity
- **Optic nerve (optic neuritis):** Vision loss (typically unilateral in MS), relative afferent pupillary defect (rAPD), red desaturation, optic nerve pallor on exam
- **Cerebellum:** Coordination issues, ataxia, scanning/telegraphic speech
- **Brainstem:** Diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) from medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lesions
- **Spinal cord (transverse myelitis):** Unilateral or bilateral numbness/weakness, neurogenic bladder, Lhermitte sign, sensory level, upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, upgoing toes, clonus)

### 5. Apply the McDonald criteria for diagnosis of MS and recognize features of common imaging findings

**McDonald Criteria** require both dissemination in space AND dissemination in time:

**Dissemination in space:** Evidence of inflammation in two distinct areas of the CNS. This can be met by:
- Clinical: symptoms affecting more than one area (e.g., optic neuritis then hemiparesis)
- Imaging: MRI T2/FLAIR lesions in at least 2 of 4 regions: (A) periventricular, (B) juxtacortical, (C) infratentorial (cerebellum/brainstem), (D) spinal cord

**Dissemination in time:** Evidence of CNS inflammation at two different time points. This can be met by:
- Clinical: history of distinct symptom bouts over time
- Imaging: One MRI with both enhancing (new, weeks old) and non-enhancing (older) lesions, OR new lesions on follow-up scan

**Imaging findings:**
- Classic appearance: multiple ovoid white matter lesions appearing bright on T2/FLAIR sequences
- "Dawson's fingers": periventricular lesions extending perpendicular to ventricles
- Corpus callosum involvement
- Spinal cord lesions less than 3 vertebral bodies in length, often "pie slice" appearance on axial imaging
- Enhancement with contrast indicates active inflammation (breakdown of blood-brain barrier)

**CSF findings:** Positive oligoclonal bands in 90-95% of cases. Oligoclonal bands represent limited classes of antibodies produced by clonally expanded B cell populations within the CNS. They are positive when bands appear in CSF but not in serum.

### 6. Discuss treatment of MS acutely and chronically, and treatment considerations related to childbearing

**Acute treatment (during flares):**
- IV methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) for 5 days
- Hastens recovery but does not modify disease course

**Long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMARDs):**
- Greater than 19 immunomodulatory medicines with various mechanisms
- Goal: treat early, prevent disability, prevent progression to SPMS
- Early initiation is vital - starting treatment after first clinical event significantly reduces accumulated disability
- Examples include:
  - Interferon beta (decreases MHC-II expression)
  - Glatiramer acetate (limits lymphocyte response to myelin basic protein)
  - Fingolimod and other sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators (retain lymphocytes in lymph nodes)
  - Natalizumab (blocks alpha4 integrins, inhibits leukocyte migration into CNS)
  - Ocrelizumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, B-cell depletion)

**Pregnancy/Childbearing considerations:**
- MS predominantly affects women in childbearing years (20s-30s)
- No MS therapy definitively proven safe during pregnancy
- Glatiramer acetate and beta interferons have not been shown harmful; teriflunomide is definitively teratogenic
- Risk of relapses decreases during pregnancy (hormonal/immune effects)
- Most women with well-controlled MS can safely discontinue medications for pregnancy
- Risk of relapse increases 3-4 months postpartum
- Breastfeeding lowers relapse risk somewhat
- All decisions require risk/benefit conversations and shared decision-making

### 7. Compare and contrast clinical and pathological features of RRMS, PPMS, NMO, and ADEM

**Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS):**
- Most common demyelinating autoimmune disease
- Age 20-40, 70% female
- Optic neuritis often unilateral with excellent recovery
- Spinal cord lesions less than or equal to 1 vertebral body length
- MRI: small ovoid periventricular/juxtacortical white matter lesions
- CSF: positive oligoclonal bands
- NMO AP4 IgG negative
- Treatment: early DMARD initiation critical

**Primary Progressive MS (PPMS):**
- Approximately 15% of MS cases
- Progressive disability from onset without distinct relapses
- Beyond detailed scope of this lecture

**Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO):**
- Age 30-50, 90% female
- Highest prevalence in Afro-Caribbean and certain Asian populations
- Severe optic neuritis, often bilateral or involves optic chiasm, with significant residual deficits
- Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (greater than 3 vertebral bodies)
- MRI brain often normal (though can have lesions in area postrema, thalami, brainstem)
- CSF: usually absent oligoclonal bands
- Positive aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG) - definitive autoimmune disease
- Pathophysiology: antibodies to aquaporin-4 on astrocyte end-feet cause complement-mediated damage
- Additional syndromes: area postrema syndrome (intractable vomiting/hiccups), brainstem syndrome, diencephalic syndrome, cerebral syndrome
- Treatment differs from MS: steroids/plasmapheresis for acute attacks; rituximab, eculizumab, inebilizumab for prevention
- Some MS DMARDs worsen NMO

**Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM):**
- Age: children much more than adults
- Autoimmune monophasic demyelination triggered by environmental stimuli (viral/bacterial infection in ~75% of cases)
- Presentation: neurologic symptoms 2-60 days (mean 26) after febrile illness
- Fever, headache, vomiting, meningismus at presentation
- Multifocal neurologic symptoms develop over days to week
- Encephalopathy (altered mental status beyond what fever alone would cause): irritability, lethargy, coma if severe
- Seizures can occur
- Severe for 2-4 weeks, often with slow, complete recovery
- MRI: diffuse, poorly demarcated, large lesions involving cerebral white matter and can involve cortical and deep grey matter (thalamus, basal ganglia)
- Pathology: small foci of perivascular demyelination without large plaques, more limited than MS
- Treatment: antibiotics empirically, then steroids once infection ruled out; IVIG or plasmapheresis if deteriorating on steroids
- Prognosis: child mortality 3%, adult 4-12%; ~10% of children have mild residual deficits vs greater than 50% adults
- No long-term disease-modifying therapy needed (monophasic)

**Key pathological differences:**
- MS: multiple plaques with perivascular inflammation, demyelination by macrophages, oligodendrocyte loss, chronic gliosis and axon loss
- NMO: complete demyelination extending over multiple spinal segments, loss of aquaporin-4 expressing astrocytes, complement deposition
- ADEM: small foci of perivascular demyelination, more restricted inflammation, better prognosis due to limited extent

## Summary

Demyelinating diseases of the CNS represent a spectrum of autoimmune conditions targeting myelin. Multiple sclerosis is the most common, characterized by relapsing-remitting inflammation affecting multiple CNS regions over time, diagnosed by dissemination in space and time, and requiring early disease-modifying therapy to prevent progression. Neuromyelitis optica is distinguished by severe optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive myelitis, positive aquaporin-4 antibodies, and different treatment requirements. ADEM is a monophasic post-infectious condition primarily affecting children with encephalopathy and multifocal deficits, typically with complete recovery. Understanding the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic criteria for these conditions is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
