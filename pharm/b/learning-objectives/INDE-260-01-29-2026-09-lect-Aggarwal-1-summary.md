## Principles of Combination Therapy

### Why Use Multiple Drugs?

**1. Reduce Toxicity**
- Using multiple drugs allows lower doses of each
- Cytotoxicity and adverse effects track together (dose-dependent)
- Strategy: use drugs with non-overlapping toxicities
- Dosing often based on Body Surface Area (BSA)

**2. Prevention of Resistance**
- **Goldie-Colman Hypothesis:** larger/faster-dividing tumors are more likely to develop drug resistance
- Resistance arises randomly (similar to bacterial antibiotic resistance)
- Example: MDR1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, which expels drugs from cells

**3. Additive/Synergistic Effects**
- Target multiple steps in the cell cycle
- Overcome tumor microenvironment barriers
- Target heterogeneous tumor cell populations

### Why Multiple Rounds of Chemotherapy?

**Fractional Killing (Log-Kill) Hypothesis**
- Cytotoxic drugs follow first-order kinetics (kill a constant fraction, not number)
- A single round cannot kill all cancer cells

**Norton-Simon Hypothesis**
- Tumor regression rate is proportional to its growth rate at that size

**Additional Reasons:**
- Not all cells are dividing at the same time
- Tumors regrow between treatments
- Multiple cycles help eliminate resistant clones

### Types of Chemotherapy

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Primary** | Main treatment (curative or palliative) |
| **Adjuvant** | Given after surgery to eliminate residual disease |
| **Neoadjuvant** | Given before surgery to shrink tumor |

## M-Phase Agents

### Vinca Alkaloids
- **Mechanism:** Bind beta-tubulin, **prevent microtubule polymerization**
- Derived from periwinkle plant

| Drug | Key Toxicity |
|------|--------------|
| **Vincristine** | **Neuropathy** (foot drop), constipation |
| **Vinblastine** | **Myelosuppression** |

### Taxanes
- **Mechanism:** **Hyperstabilize** microtubules (prevent breakdown)
- Derived from Pacific yew tree

| Drug | Key Toxicities |
|------|----------------|
| **Paclitaxel** | Myelosuppression, neuropathy, hypersensitivity reaction |

**Key Point:** Both Vinca alkaloids and taxanes disrupt mitosis but through opposite mechanisms - both lead to cell death.

## G1/G0 Agents (Non-Cell Cycle Specific)

### Alkylating Agents
- **Mechanism:** Cross-link DNA at guanine (N7 position)

| Drug | Key Features | Key Toxicities |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Cyclophosphamide** | Prodrug activated by CYP2B6 in liver to phosphoramide mustard (active) + acrolein (toxic) | **Hemorrhagic cystitis** (from acrolein) - treat with **mesna**; SIADH at high doses |
| **Busulfan** | Used in bone marrow transplant conditioning | **Pulmonary fibrosis** |
| **Carmustine** | Crosses blood-brain barrier | Used for brain tumors |

### Platinum Analogs
- **Mechanism:** Undergo aquation, then bind N7 of guanine creating intrastrand and interstrand cross-links, preventing DNA replication

| Drug | Generation | Key Toxicities |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Cisplatin** | 1st | **Ototoxicity** (irreversible), **nephrotoxicity** - prevent with amifostine and saline |
| **Carboplatin** | 2nd | **Bone marrow suppression** |
| **Oxaliplatin** | 3rd | Neuropathy |

**Key Point:** Same drug class can have different toxicity profiles.

## S-Phase Agents (Antimetabolites)

### Purine Synthesis Inhibitors

| Drug | Mechanism | Key Points |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Azathioprine/6-Mercaptopurine** | Purine analog; converted by HGPRT to guanine analog that inhibits DNA replication | Allopurinol interaction (xanthine oxidase inhibitor increases toxicity); AE: GI, dermatologic, hepatotoxicity |

### Pyrimidine Synthesis Inhibitors

| Drug | Mechanism | Key Toxicities |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Cytarabine** | Cytosine analog incorporated into DNA, blocks DNA polymerase | **Pancerebellar syndrome** (ataxia, dysarthria, oculomotor issues), pancytopenia |
| **5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)** | Multiple mechanisms: FdUMP inhibits thymidylate synthase; FdUTP incorporated into DNA; FUTP incorporated into RNA | **Hand-foot syndrome**, myelosuppression, GI toxicity; test for **DPD deficiency** |
| **Methotrexate** | Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, depleting reduced folates needed for thymidine synthesis | Myelosuppression - **rescue with leucovorin** (reduced folate) |

**Key Point:** Drugs crossing the BBB can cause specific CNS toxicities (e.g., cytarabine).

## G2-Phase Agents

### Topoisomerase Inhibitors

| Drug | Target | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Teniposide/Etoposide** | Topoisomerase II | Wild mandrake |
| **Topotecan/Irinotecan** | Topoisomerase I | - |

---

## Anti-Tumor Antibiotics

*Named "antibiotics" because they are derived from Streptomyces bacteria*

### Anthracyclines
- **Mechanism:** Multiple - inhibit topoisomerase II, generate free radicals, bind DNA with high affinity, alter cell membrane mechanics

| Drug | Key Toxicity |
|------|--------------|
| **Doxorubicin/Daunorubicin** | **Dilated cardiomyopathy** (cumulative dose-dependent) - can use **dexrazoxane** for cardioprotection |

### Bleomycin
- **Mechanism:** Oxygen-dependent free radical-mediated DNA damage
- **Key Toxicity:** **Pulmonary fibrosis/pneumonitis** (cumulative dose)
- **Notable:** Minimal bone marrow toxicity

## Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Rapid tumor cell death releases intracellular contents causing metabolic derangements:

| Finding | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Hyperkalemia** | Release of intracellular K+ |
| **Hyperphosphatemia** | Release from DNA breakdown |
| **Hypocalcemia** | Ca-Phosphate precipitation |
| **Hyperuricemia** | Purine breakdown to uric acid |
| **Urate nephropathy** | Uric acid crystal deposition in kidneys |

### Management

| Drug | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Allopurinol** | Xanthine oxidase inhibitor - prevents uric acid formation |
| **Rasburicase** | Recombinant uricase - converts uric acid to allantoin (more soluble) |

## Key Takeaways

1. Combination therapy reduces toxicity, prevents resistance, and provides synergistic effects
2. Multiple chemotherapy rounds are needed because drugs kill a constant fraction of cells (log-kill)
3. Cell cycle-specific agents (M-phase, S-phase, G2-phase) work best on actively dividing cells
4. Non-cell cycle-specific agents (alkylating agents, platinum analogs) can kill cells in G0/G1
5. Know the characteristic toxicities: vincristine = neuropathy, vinblastine = myelosuppression, cisplatin = ototoxicity/nephrotoxicity, doxorubicin = cardiotoxicity, bleomycin = pulmonary fibrosis
6. Supportive medications (mesna, leucovorin, dexrazoxane, allopurinol) help mitigate specific toxicities
7. Tumor lysis syndrome requires prophylaxis and monitoring in high-risk patients
