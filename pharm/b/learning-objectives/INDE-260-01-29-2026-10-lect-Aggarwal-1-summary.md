## The Small Molecule Inhibitor Revolution

### Historical Context: Imatinib and CML

**Timeline:**
- **1960:** Philadelphia chromosome (t9;22 translocation) identified in CML
- **1980:** c-ABL found to have tyrosine kinase activity
- **1984:** BCR-ABL fusion protein identified as constitutively active tyrosine kinase
- **1988:** Rational drug design begins targeting BCR-ABL
- **1995:** Lead compound (imatinib) selected
- **1998:** Near 100% response rates in clinical trials
- **2001:** FDA approval - transformed CML from fatal disease to manageable chronic condition

**Dr. Brian Druker** championed imatinib development despite initial industry reluctance.

### Why Small Molecule Inhibitors Are Revolutionary

1. **Precision targeting** of oncogenic drivers (not just killing dividing cells)
2. **Improved efficacy with fewer side effects** (spare normal cells)
3. **Overcome drug resistance** by targeting signaling pathways
4. **Target intracellular signaling** (previously "undruggable")
5. **Oral administration** (vs. IV chemotherapy)
6. **Biomarker-driven therapy** (companion diagnostics)

## Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)

### Basic Signaling Framework

**Input:** Receptor dimerization and kinase domain activation

**Signal Transducers (Kinase Cascades):**
- MAPK/MEK pathway
- PI3K-Akt pathway
- JAK-STAT pathway
- PLCγ-PKC pathway

**Output:** Proliferation, growth, differentiation, survival, migration

### Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) Family

| Receptor | Also Known As | Key Cancers |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **EGFR** | HER1, ErbB-1 | Colorectal, head/neck, lung |
| **HER2** | ErbB-2, neu | Breast, gastric |
| **HER3** | ErbB-3 | Breast, lung (dimerizes with HER2*) |
| **HER4** | ErbB-4 | Less studied |

*HER3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, relies on HER2 for signaling

## BCR-ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

### Mechanism
- TKIs block the **ATP-binding site** of BCR-ABL
- Prevent phosphorylation and downstream signaling

### Clinical Uses
- **CML** (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia)
- **Ph+ ALL** (Philadelphia chromosome-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)
- **GIST** (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor) - via c-KIT/PDGFR inhibition

| Generation | Drug | Targets | Key Toxicities |
|------------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1st | **Imatinib** | BCR-ABL, c-KIT, PDGFR | Fluid retention (periorbital edema), nausea, myelosuppression |
| 2nd | **Dasatinib** | BCR-ABL (including some resistant mutations), SRC, c-KIT, PDGFR | **Pleural effusions** |
| 2nd | Nilotinib, Bosutinib | Same as dasatinib | - |
| 3rd | **Ponatinib** | BCR-ABL (including **T315I mutation**), FGFR, VEGFR | Vascular events |

**Key Point:** TKIs can be non-selective because kinases share similar ATP-binding domains; this allows treatment based on molecular target rather than tissue of origin.

## EGFR Inhibitors

### Mechanism
- Inhibit tyrosine kinase domain (ATP-binding site) of EGFR

| Drug | Cancer | Features |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Gefitinib** | EGFR-mutant NSCLC (exon 19 deletions, L858R) | Resistance develops via **T790M mutation** |
| **Erlotinib** | EGFR-mutant NSCLC, Pancreatic cancer | Resistance via T790M |
| **Neratinib** | HER2+ Breast cancer | **Irreversible** inhibitor; severe **diarrhea** (prophylactic loperamide) |
| **Dacomitinib** | EGFR-mutant NSCLC | **Irreversible**, more toxic than gefitinib |

---

## Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

### JAK Inhibitors

| Drug | Target | Clinical Use | Key Toxicities |
|------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Ruxolitinib** | JAK1/2 | Polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis | Anemia, viral/TB reactivation |
| **Tofacitinib** | JAK1/3 | Rheumatoid arthritis | MACE, VTE, TB/viral reactivation |

---

## Serine/Threonine Kinase Inhibitors

### BRAF/MEK Pathway

- **BRAF V600E mutation** present in ~60% of melanomas
- BRAF is part of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade

### BRAF Inhibitors (-rafenib)

| Drug | Key Toxicities |
|------|----------------|
| **Vemurafenib** | Skin lesions, photosensitivity, rashes, arthralgias |
| Dabrafenib, Encorafenib | Similar |

### MEK Inhibitors (-metinib)

| Drug | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Cobimetinib** | Combined with BRAF inhibitors for melanoma |
| Trametinib, Binmetinib | Similar |

**Key Point:** Combining BRAF + MEK inhibitors prevents downstream pathway reactivation that causes resistance.

## Resistance Mechanisms

### 1. Target-Related Resistance

**Point Mutations in Kinase Domain:**
- **T315I in BCR-ABL:** Resistant to imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib (only ponatinib works)
- **T790M in EGFR:** Resistant to 1st generation TKIs

**Gene Amplification:**
- Increased copies of oncogene overwhelm inhibitor effect
- Examples: EGFR amplification in lung cancer, BCR-ABL amplification in CML

### 2. Bypass Mechanisms

Cancer cells activate parallel signaling pathways:
- **MET amplification** bypasses EGFR inhibition
- **SRC activation** bypasses BCR-ABL inhibition
- **PI3K/AKT upregulation** overcomes HER2 inhibition

### 3. Drug Efflux/Influx

**Efflux (Increased):**
- P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/MDR1) pumps drug out of cells
- Solution: use different generation drugs or efflux inhibitors

**Influx (Decreased):**
- Reduced expression of uptake transporters (OCT-1, OATPs)

## Proteasome Inhibitors (-zomib)

### Mechanism
- Proteasome normally degrades ubiquitinated proteins
- Inhibition prevents degradation of **pro-apoptotic factors**

| Drug | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Bortezomib** | Boron atom binds catalytic site; reversible |
| **Carfilzomib** | Irreversible |
| **Ixazomib** | Oral |

**Clinical Use:** Multiple myeloma

**Key Toxicities:** Neuropathy, immunosuppression

---

## CDK4/6 Inhibitors (-ciclib)

### Mechanism
- Inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6
- Block G1 checkpoint (restriction point) progression
- Prevent phosphorylation of Rb protein

### Clinical Use
- **HR+/HER2- breast cancer** (combined with endocrine therapy)

| Drug | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Palbociclib** | Used with endocrine therapy |
| **Ribociclib** | QT prolongation risk |
| **Abemaciclib** | Monotherapy option; more CDK4 selective; CNS penetration; causes diarrhea |

**Key Toxicity:** Neutropenia

**Resistance:** PI3K/AKT pathway activation bypasses CDK4/6 inhibition
