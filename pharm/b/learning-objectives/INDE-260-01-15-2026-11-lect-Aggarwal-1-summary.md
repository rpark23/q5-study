## Key Concepts

### 1. Bioequivalence

Bioequivalence is a critical factor for generic drug approval, beyond Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements. This concept focuses on pharmacokinetics.

**Requirements:**
- AUC(0-t) must be between 80-125% of the marketed preparation
- Cmax must be between 80-125% of the marketed preparation

These parameters ensure that generic drugs deliver similar drug exposure to brand-name medications.

### 2. Special Populations

Special populations are defined as groups outside those typically included in Phase 2/3 clinical trials. The main focus for these populations is safety.

**Key Special Populations:**
- Pregnancy
- Children
- Elderly
- Hepatic impairment
- Renal impairment

**Differences Between Phase 1 and Phase 3 Subjects:**
- Age: Phase 1 usually includes ages 18-40, while Phase 3 includes higher percentages of older patients
- Pregnancy: Excluded from both phases
- Race: Phase 1 predominantly Caucasian, Phase 3 includes all races
- Organ function: Phase 1 subjects have normal function, Phase 3 often includes at least minor impairment
- Weight: Phase 1 subjects typically have BMI lower than 25 kg/m², Phase 3 includes greater percentage of obese individuals

Pharmacogenetics enables personalized treatment using genetic classification of patients to guide drug choice and dosing recommendations.

### 3. Pharmacogenomics in Clinical Practice

Common drugs with pharmacogenomic guidelines include:

**Lipid-lowering agents:**
- Atorvastatin, Simvastatin (SLCO1B1 gene)

**Antidepressants:**
- Citalopram, Sertraline (CYP2C19)
- Amitriptyline (CYP2C19, CYP2D6)

**Analgesics:**
- Codeine, Tramadol (CYP2D6)

**Anticoagulants:**
- Warfarin (VKORC1, CYP2C9)

**Anticonvulsants:**
- Carbamazepine (HLA-B)

**Antibiotics:**
- Flucloxacillin (HLA-B)

### 4. Black Box Warnings

Black box warnings, also known as boxed warnings, are separated and highlighted from other text in package inserts. They are generally the result of Phase 4 (post-marketing) results.

**Examples:**
- **Fluoroquinolones:** Tendonitis/tendon rupture, irreversible peripheral neuropathy
- **Antidepressants:** Increased risk of suicidal ideation/thinking
- **NSAIDs:** Increased risk of heart attacks and stroke
- **Valproic Acid:** Hepatotoxicity/Pancreatitis
- **Carbamazepine:** Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/serious dermatological disorders; genetic testing for HLA-B*1502 allele recommended

The HLA-B*1502 allele is particularly prevalent in Eastern Asia (200.1 million, 1/8), Southern Asia (283.2 million, 1/9), and less common in other populations.

### 5. Drug Scheduling

Drug scheduling is determined by both the FDA and DEA, and enforced by the DEA. It is based on a combination of:
- Potential for abuse
- Potential for addiction
- Medical use

**Schedule Classifications:**

| Schedule | Medical Use | Abuse Potential | Addiction Potential | Examples |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| I | No | High | High | Heroin, LSD, cannabis, ecstasy, methaqualone, peyote |
| II | Yes (restricted) | High | Moderate-High | Adderall, Vicodin, cocaine, fentanyl, Ritalin, Dexedrine, oxycodone, methamphetamine, methadone, Vyvanse, hydromorphone, Concerta, meperidine |
| III | Yes | Moderate | Moderate | Ketamine, Tylenol with codeine, anabolic steroids, testosterone |
| IV | Yes | Low-Moderate | Low-Moderate | Xanax, Soma, Ambien, Tramadol, Valium, Ativan, Darvocet, Darvon, Talwin |
| V | Yes | Low | Low | Robitussin AC, Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, Parepectolin |

**Human Abuse Liability (HAL) Studies** assess a drug's effects on mood, perception, and behaviors in comparison to known substances of abuse.

Schedule I and II drug production is controlled by quota systems.

### 6. Prescribing Regulations

**Scope of Practice:**
- Determined by state medical boards

**Drug Scheduling (Controlled Substances):**
- States vs Federal Government (DEA)
- International Treaties:
  - Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961)
  - Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971)
  - UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988)

**Available to Prescribe:**
- FDA determines which drugs are available

### 7. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)

REMS are mandated drug safety programs by the FDA for medications with serious side effects, such as:
- High potential for abuse
- Severe side effects
- Teratogenic side effects

**Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU):**
- Special training or certification for prescribers/dispensers
- Patient enrollment in a registry
- Dispensing only in specific settings (e.g., hospitals)
- Monitoring requirements, such as regular follow-up or lab tests

Drug manufacturers are responsible for implementing and maintaining their REMS programs.

### 8. Special Populations and Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics

**Pharmacokinetics (PK):** Effects of the biological system on the drug (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination)

**Pharmacodynamics (PD):** Effects of the drug on the biological system (drug-receptor interactions)

### 9. Pregnancy and Pharmacokinetics

**Distribution Changes:**
- Increased body fat/water increases distribution of drugs
- Decreased plasma proteins result in decreased drug binding and increased free fraction
- Plasma volume increases by approximately 50% by third trimester
- Albumin decreases by 20-30%

**Metabolism Changes:**
- Liver enzyme activity changes throughout pregnancy
- CYP2D6 and CYP2A6 increase significantly (up to 200%)
- Some enzymes like CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 may decrease

**Elimination Changes:**
- Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may result in increased clearance of drugs
- This can be counteracted with increased tubular resorption
- Kidney function increases by approximately 40-50%

**Example:** Lithium experiences increased distribution and increased elimination during pregnancy, requiring dose adjustments.

### 10. Teratogenicity Classification

**Former FDA Pregnancy Categories (replaced by PLLR):**

| Category | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| A | Controlled studies show no risk in humans |
| B | No evidence of risk in humans, but animal studies show risk (or animal studies show no risk and absence of human data) |
| C | Risk cannot be ruled out, human studies lacking and animal studies are positive or lacking. Potential benefits may justify risk |
| D | Positive evidence of risk; data showing risk potentially to fetus; however, benefits may outweigh potential risk |
| X | Contraindicated in pregnancy. Studies in animals or humans have shown fetal risk that clearly outweighs possible benefit to the patient |

**Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR)** replaced these categories to provide more detailed information:

**Pregnancy Section:** Includes data on fetal risk, clinical considerations, and supporting studies

**Lactation Section:** Addresses drug presence in breast milk and effects on breastfeeding

**Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:** Includes information on pregnancy testing, contraception, and infertility

**W/TERATOgenic Mnemonic:**
- **W**arfarin
- **T**halidomide
- **E**pileptic drugs: phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine
- **R**etinoid
- **A**CE inhibitors
- **T**hird element: lithium
- **O**CP and other hormones

### 11. Breastfeeding Considerations

The milk-to-plasma ratio is often used as a surrogate to understand the safety of drugs during breastfeeding.

**Anesthesia and Breastfeeding:**
Research has shown that receiving anesthesia should not affect a mother's ability to breastfeed or the safety of breast milk. Various perioperative medications have been studied and most can proceed with breastfeeding.

### 12. Placental Transfer

The syncytiotrophoblast layer is the rate-limiting step for drug transfer across the placenta.

**Complexity of Placental Transfer:**
- Ion trapping occurs due to differences in pH between maternal and fetal blood
- Only free (unbound) drug crosses the placenta
- Passive diffusion is the primary mechanism
- Active transport mechanisms exist
- Metabolism can occur in the placenta itself

### 13. Pediatric Populations

**Distribution:**
- Neonates are approximately 80% water (affects water-soluble drugs)
- Protein concentrations are lower for the first year of life

**Metabolism:**
- Hepatic metabolism is not mature at birth
- Dealkylation is normal
- Conjugation is reduced for the first month
- Glucuronidation normalizes at 3-6 months
- Oxidation normalizes at 6-12 months
- Cytochrome activity normalizes over years

**Elimination:**
- GFR is reduced at birth
- Reaches adult levels at 3 months
- Then exceeds adult levels for a period

**Regulatory History:**
- 1970s: PK/PD studies begin in children
- 1997-1998: FDA Modernization Act and Pediatric Rule (later replaced by Pediatric Research Equity Act)

**Dosing Considerations:**
Neonatal dosing often differs significantly from adult dosing. For example, neonatal daily doses can be 2-fold higher or 0.5-fold lower than adult doses when normalized by weight, depending on the drug and the maturation of metabolic pathways.

### 14. Geriatric Populations

**Absorption:**
- Decreased gastric acid production
- Decreased small bowel surface area
- These changes create challenges for drug absorption

**Distribution:**
- Increased proportion of body fat
- Possibly decreased P-glycoprotein activity at the blood-brain barrier
- These changes affect lipophilic drug distribution

**Metabolism:**
- Decreased cytochrome/hepatic activity
- Polypharmacy increases risk of drug-drug interactions

**Elimination:**
- Decreased renal clearance (inulin clearance declines with age in both men and women)

**Clinical Implications:**
Plasma half-life increases with age for many drugs. For example, diazepam's plasma half-life increases from approximately 20 hours at age 20 to over 80 hours at age 80.

### 15. Organ Impairment

**Renal Impairment Classification:**

| Group | Description | Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Normal renal function | >80 |
| 2 | Mild renal impairment | 50-80 |
| 3 | Moderate renal impairment | 30-50 |
| 4 | Severe renal impairment | <30 |
| 5 | ESRD (End-stage renal disease) | Requires dialysis |

**Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Score):**

| Child-Pugh Score | Grade of Dysfunction |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 5-6 | Grade A or well compensated |
| 7-9 | Grade B or significant functional compromise |
| 10-15 | Grade C or decompensated liver disease |

**Hepatic Metabolism Phases:**
- **Phase I:** Functionalization (e.g., CYP450 enzymes) produces drug intermediates
- **Phase II:** Conjugation (e.g., N-acetyltransferases) produces drug intermediates
- **Phase III:** Transport (e.g., ABC transporters) leads to urinary or biliary excretion

### 16. Body Composition and Drug Dosing

**Weight-Based Dosing Considerations:**

**Ideal Body Weight (IBW):** A theoretical weight based on height, used as a baseline reference

**Total Body Weight (TBW):** The actual measured weight of the patient

**Lean Body Weight (LBW):** The weight of the body excluding fat, used for dosing lipophilic drugs

**Example - Propofol Dosing:**
- **Induction:** Dosed based on Lean Body Weight
- **Maintenance:** Dosed based on Total Body Weight

**Weight Composition by BMI:**
As BMI increases from normal weight to super morbidly obese, the proportion of fat weight increases dramatically while lean body weight increases more modestly. This has significant implications for drug distribution and dosing.

## Clinical Applications

Understanding these pharmacological principles is essential for:
- Selecting appropriate medications for special populations
- Adjusting doses based on patient characteristics
- Recognizing genetic factors that influence drug response
- Understanding drug safety warnings and restrictions
- Navigating prescribing regulations
- Optimizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects

## Looking Ahead

The lecture concludes with a preview of antibiotic history, featuring historical images of penicillin development and the pioneers of antibiotic therapy: Sir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), Ernst Boris Chain (1906-1979), and Sir Howard Walter Florey (1898-1968).
