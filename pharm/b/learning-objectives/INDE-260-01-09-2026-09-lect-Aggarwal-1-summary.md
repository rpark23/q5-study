## Historical Context of Drug Regulation

### Early History
- First recorded prescriptions date to 2200 BC in modern-day Iraq
- First compounded medicines recorded in 6th century BC (Sushruta Samhita)
- Late 700s saw the first private pharmacies and separation of physician from apothecary

### Key Regulatory Milestones

**Drug Importation Act of 1848**
- Response to concerns about drug quality for US troops during Mexican-American War

**Pure Food and Drugs Act (1906)**
- Triggered by muckraking journalism and Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle"
- Harvey Wiley and the "Poison Squad" tested food additives
- Required accurate labeling and sanitary production conditions

**1927 - FDA Splits Off**
- FDA becomes separate regulatory entity

**Elixir Sulfanilamide Tragedy (1937)**
- Diethylene glycol in drug preparation led to over 100 deaths
- Led to Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938
- Required drugs to be tested for safety before marketing

**Thalidomide Tragedy (Late 1950s)**
- Thalidomide marketed for morning sickness
- Dr. Frances Kelsey repeatedly denied US approval due to insufficient safety data
- Prevented widespread birth defects (phocomelia) in the United States
- Led to Kefauver-Harris Amendment (1962)
- Mandated proof of both drug efficacy AND safety before FDA approval

## Drug Discovery and Preclinical Development

### Methods of New Drug Identification

1. **Screening compounds** for biologic activity
2. **Chemical modification** of known active molecules
3. **Identification of new drug targets**
4. **Rational design** of new molecules (e.g., Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir for COVID-19)

### Animal Models

Preclinical drug screening historically uses animal models. The ideal animal model should have:

1. Similar genetic basis to humans
2. Similar anatomy and physiology
3. Similar underlying mechanism and pathological response
4. Similar phenotypic endpoints
5. Responsiveness to known drugs with clinical efficacy
6. Predictive value for clinical efficacy

### Preclinical Toxicity Testing

Preclinical data is required before submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Testing evaluates toxicity and basic properties in biological systems:

| Type of Test | Approach and Goals |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Acute toxicity** | 2 species, 2 routes. Determine no-effect dose and maximum tolerated dose |
| **Subacute toxicity** | 3 doses, 2 species. 2 weeks to 3 months testing prior to clinical trials |
| **Chronic toxicity** | Rodent and at least one nonrodent species for 6+ months. Required for prolonged human use. Often runs concurrently with clinical trials |
| **Reproductive performance** | 2 species (usually rodents and rabbits). Tests mating behavior, reproduction, parturition, progeny, birth defects, and postnatal development |
| **Carcinogenic potential** | 2 years, 2 species. Required when drug intended for prolonged human use |
| **Mutagenic potential** | Tests genetic stability and mutations in bacteria or mammalian cell culture |

## IND Application Requirements

Before human testing, an IND application must include:

1. Information on composition and source of drug
2. Chemical and manufacturing information
3. All data from animal studies
4. Proposed plan for clinical trials
5. Individuals/physicians who will conduct trials
6. Any preclinical data in humans (if available)

Additionally, IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval is required to ensure scientific and ethical testing plans.

## Clinical Trial Phases

### Phase 1
- **Participants:** 20-100 healthy volunteers (exceptions exist)
- **Goal:** Establish effects of drug as a function of dose
- **Focus:** Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD)

**Types of Phase 1 Studies:**
- Single Ascending Dose
- Multiple Ascending Dose
- Bioavailability/Bioequivalence/Mass Balance
- Food Effect
- Drug Interaction
- Organ Impairment
- Special populations
- QTc Effects

### Phase 2
- **Participants:** Hundreds of patients
- **Duration:** Months to 1 year
- **Question:** "Does it work, and what dose?"
- **Design:** Several small controlled studies (dose-ranging)
- **Endpoints:** Intermediate or surrogate endpoints
- **Significance:** Go/No-Go decision point for development

### Phase 3
- **Participants:** Thousands of patients
- **Duration:** 1 to several years
- **Question:** "Is it safe and effective?"
- **Design:** Large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), typically multicenter
- **Endpoints:** Clinical endpoints
- **Significance:** Definitive data for regulatory approval and market authorization

### Phase 4
- **Timing:** After NDA (New Drug Application) approval
- **Also known as:** Post-marketing surveillance
- **Duration:** No end date
- **Goals:**
  - Evaluate long-term safety and efficacy
  - Identify new indications
  - Study additional patient populations
  - Demonstrate value to payors

## Diversity in Clinical Trials

Historical lack of diversity has been addressed through:

- **1993 - NIH Revitalization Act:** Inclusion of women and racial/ethnic minorities in clinical research
- **2019 - FDA Guidance:** "Considerations for the Inclusion of Adolescent Patients in Adult Oncology Clinical Trials"
- **2020 - FDA Guidance:** "Enhancing Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations"

Despite these efforts, enrollment data (2008-2017) shows persistent underrepresentation of women and minorities in pivotal trials for cardiometabolic drugs.

## Special FDA Designations

**First-in-Class**
- Drugs with new/unique mechanism of action (no regulatory implications)

**Orphan Drug**
- Drug for rare disease (affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States)

**Accelerated Approval**
- Early approval based on markers predictive of reasonable benefit
- Requires additional post-approval testing to confirm clinical benefit

**Expanded Access (Compassionate Use)**
- Allows individuals with serious/life-threatening illness to access investigational drugs outside clinical trials

**Fast-Track**
- Designation for drugs treating unmet medical needs

**Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)**
- Allows FDA to make unapproved products available during emergencies
- Requires declaration from other agencies or recognition of CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) threat

**Breakthrough Therapy**
- Drug with preliminary clinical evidence showing substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over current therapy

## Generics and Patents

### Hatch-Waxman Act (1984)
- Allowed use of Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA)
- Brought numerous generics to market
- Political compromise: longer patent protections and exclusivity for new drugs

### Current State
- 90% of medications in the US are generics
- 40% are produced in India
- 80% of active ingredients for all medications are made overseas
- Real per capita spending on prescription drugs increased sevenfold from 1980 to 2018

### Patent Issues
- Pharmaceutical companies use various strategies to extend patents
- Trade secrets also protect formulations
- Generic availability reduces costs but patent extensions delay this benefit

---

## Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)

Regulations enforced by the FDA with five key components:
1. Primary materials and products
2. Premises
3. People
4. Procedures
5. Processes

**Key Principle:** Testing alone is not enough to ensure quality

**Quality Control Issues:**
- Carcinogens have infiltrated generic drug supply
- Heparin contamination was potentially deliberate (2008)
- Thyroid medication interchange issues led to joint position statements from professional societies

## State of Drug Development

### Eroom's Law
- Describes 80-fold decrease in R&D efficiency since 1950 (Moore's Law backwards)
- Peak decline occurred post-thalidomide when FDA tightened regulations

### Reasons for Declining Efficiency
1. Improving catalog of existing medications raises the bar for new drugs
2. Increased evidence requirements for approval and reimbursement
3. Lower risk tolerance among regulators and companies
4. Financial benefits of being first to market require large resource investment

### Recent Trends
- Evidence since 2012 suggests reversal of this trend
- Increases in orphan drugs and targeted cancer therapies
- First wave of biotech drugs contributing to new approvals

### Development Costs and Timeline
- Cost increased from $1.18 billion (2010) to $2.17 billion (2018)
- Average development time: 10-15 years
- Both preclinical and clinical costs have increased dramatically since the 1970s

## Case Study: Atorvastatin (Lipitor)

### Timeline
- **1850s:** Lipid Hypothesis established
- **1948:** Framingham Heart Study highlights heart attack risk factors
- **1970s:** Dr. Akira Endo isolates first statin (mevastatin) in Japan
- **1985:** Atorvastatin synthesized; Warner-Lambert concerned it was a "me-too" drug
- **1986:** Patent approved for atorvastatin
- **1994:** Merck study shows statins lower cholesterol and reduce heart attacks
- **1996:** Atorvastatin brought to market through Warner-Lambert/Pfizer partnership
- **2000:** Pfizer acquires Warner-Lambert for $90 billion
- **2011:** Patent expires after generating $125 billion in sales

### Significance
Demonstrates the long development timeline from basic research to blockbuster drug and the importance of marketing partnerships.

## Case Study: Remdesivir

### Background Development
- **2009:** Developed to treat Hepatitis C and RSV (failed; IV formulation only)
- **2015:** US Army Medical Research Institute tested for Ebola (not as effective as alternatives)
- **December 2019:** Gilead reactivates research for potential coronavirus treatment

### COVID-19 Timeline
- **January 8, 2020:** SARS-CoV-2 proven as cause of COVID-19
- **January 19:** First US case presents with 4 days of symptoms
- **January 20:** First confirmed US case
- **January 26:** Patient treated with remdesivir via expanded access (day 7 of hospitalization)
- **March 2020:** Received orphan drug status (later withdrawn due to backlash)
- **May 1, 2020:** Emergency Use Authorization granted
- **October 2020:** Full FDA approval for COVID-19

### Manufacturing Challenges
- Manufacturing process reduced from 12 months to 6 months
- IV solubility requires 30:1 ratio with Captisol
- Initial supply came from existing Ebola research stockpiles

### Financial Impact
- 2021 revenue: $4.5 billion from remdesivir alone
- Raises questions about appropriate pricing and who should bear development costs
- Illustrates challenges with antibiotic/antiviral development (not commercially attractive to pharmaceutical firms)

### Broader Context
- New gonorrhea antibiotic (zoliflodacin) developed by non-profit foundation
- Demonstrates that antibiotics lack commercial appeal despite public health need
- Government and non-profit funding may be necessary for pandemic preparedness
