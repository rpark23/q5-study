## What Are Biologics?

Biologics are large, complex molecules produced using living cells. They include:
- Hormones
- Human cells/tissues
- Blood products/components
- Gene therapies
- Recombinant DNA products
- Therapeutic signaling molecules
- Enzymes
- Monoclonal antibodies

### Three Main Categories:

1. **Protein/peptide biologics ("signaling biologics")**: Hormones, peptides, growth factors
2. **Monoclonal antibodies and Fc-fusions ("binding biologics")**: mAbs, bispecifics, antibody fragments
3. **Nucleic-acid therapeutics ("gene-expression biologics")**: Antisense oligos, siRNA, mRNA therapeutics, gene therapy

## Biologics vs Small Molecule Drugs

### Key Differences:

| Feature | Biologics | Small Molecules |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Size** | Large (~150 kDa) | Small (~0.5 kDa) |
| **Structure** | Complex, cannot be fully characterized | Simple, well-defined |
| **Manufacturing** | Complex (>1000 steps), product depends on process | Simple, independent of manufacturing |
| **Stability** | Unstable, sensitive to external conditions | Stable |
| **Immunogenicity** | High risk | Generally non-immunogenic |
| **Specificity** | Very specific to target | More off-target effects |
| **Success rate** | 20-25% | ~7% |

### Pharmacokinetic Differences:

- **Formulation**: Biologics typically require sterile isotonic solutions (cannot be taken orally)
- **Absorption**: Slow via lymphatic system (vs. variable for small molecules)
- **Distribution**: Receptor-mediated endocytosis, very low volume of distribution
- **Elimination**: Via reticuloendothelial system catabolism (not hepatic/renal)
- **Clearance**: Very low
- **Half-life**: Weeks to months (vs. hours to days)
- **Dosing**: Weekly or monthly (vs. daily or multiple times daily)

## Biosimilars and Biobetters

**Biosimilars** are "generic" biologics that are highly similar to an approved reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency. They are named by adding four random letters to the end (e.g., Bevacizumab-awwb).

**Biobetters** are modified versions of biologics with improved efficacy, safety, stability, or dosing.

## Monoclonal Antibody Nomenclature

### Naming Convention (pre-2022):
**Prefix + Target + Source + -mab**

**Target indicators:**
- -ci: cardiovascular
- -ki: cytokine
- -ne: neural
- -os: bone
- -ta/tu: tumor
- -vi: viral
- -li: immunomodulating

**Source indicators:**
- -u: human
- -zu: humanized
- -xi: chimeric
- -o: mouse

*Note: Source indicators were removed after 2017 as non-human/humanized antibodies are no longer considered safe due to immunogenic potential*

### New Naming Convention (2022+):

| Suffix | Format | Properties |
|--------|--------|------------|
| -tug | Full-length IgG | Standard, longest half-life |
| -bart | Fc-modified IgG | Modified immune engagement |
| -mig | Bi/multispecific | Targets multiple antigens |
| -ment | Fragment-based | Smaller, better tissue penetration, shorter half-life |

## Cancer-Targeting Monoclonal Antibodies

### Mechanisms of Action:
1. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
2. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP)
3. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC)
4. Blocking cellular growth signaling/positive interactions
5. Triggering cytotoxic activity via receptor dysfunction

### Rituximab
- **Target**: CD20 on B cells
- **Mechanism**: Destruction of B cells via ADCC, ADCP, CDC
- **Uses**: Autoimmune conditions (RA, ITP, TTP, AIHA, MS), B-cell malignancies (Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL, Waldenström macroglobulinemia)
- **Adverse effects**: Infusion reactions, cytokine release syndrome, tumor lysis, PML
- **Note**: Does not cause significant increase in infections because only B cells are affected

### Bevacizumab
- **Target**: VEGF-A (blocks angiogenesis)
- **Uses**: Colon cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, age-related macular degeneration
- **Adverse effects**: Poor wound healing, worsening CAD/PAD

### Cetuximab (and Panitumumab)
- **Target**: EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- **Uses**: Colorectal cancer (with wild-type KRAS), head/neck cancers
- **Adverse effects**: Elevated LFTs, rash, diarrhea (due to EGFR expression in liver, skin, GI epithelium)

## Checkpoint Inhibitors

### Anti-PD-1 Antibodies: Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab, Cemiplimab

- **Pembrolizumab approval**: Any solid tumor with mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability (MSI-high/dMMR)
- **Uses**: Melanoma, lung cancer, head/neck cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, stomach cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer
- **Rationale**: MSI-high tumors produce many neoantigens, making them more visible to immune system
- **Adverse effects**: Autoimmune reactions (pneumonitis, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, renal inflammation, hepatitis, dermatitis)

### Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies: Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, Avelumab
- **Mechanism**: Block PD-L1 on cancer cells
- **Uses**: Urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer
- **Adverse effects**: Similar autoimmune reactions as anti-PD-1

- **Mechanism**: Blocks CTLA-4 "brake" on T cells
- **Uses**: Metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, certain colorectal cancers
- **Adverse effects**: Immune-related adverse events (can be fatal)
- **Concept**: Unleashes immune system to fight cancer at risk of autoimmunity

## Important Clinical Concepts

1. **Specificity vs. Side Effects**: Even highly specific biologics can have unintended effects (e.g., trastuzumab causing cardiac dysfunction)

2. **Tissue Expression Patterns**: Understanding where receptors are expressed helps predict side effects (e.g., EGFR in skin/GI/liver explains cetuximab side effects)

3. **Combination Therapy**: Biologics can be combined even for the same target if they bind different regions (e.g., trastuzumab + pertuzumab)

4. **Genotype-Directed Therapy**: Modern cancer treatment increasingly relies on molecular markers, not just gross pathology (e.g., KRAS status for cetuximab, HER2 status for trastuzumab, MSI status for pembrolizumab)

5. **Resistance Mechanisms**: Downstream mutations can confer resistance to targeted therapies (e.g., KRAS mutations bypass EGFR inhibition)

6. **Cost Considerations**: Biologics are expensive, with some costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per year

7. **Biosimilar Naming**: Four random letters added to end of reference product name

8. **Manufacturing Importance**: For biologics, the manufacturing process defines the product (unlike small molecules)

- They offer higher specificity but come with unique challenges (manufacturing complexity, instability, immunogenicity, cost)
- Understanding receptor families (like EGFR/HER family) and their expression patterns is crucial for predicting efficacy and side effects
- Checkpoint inhibitors work by "unleashing" the immune system, with predictable autoimmune risks
- Modern cancer therapy increasingly relies on molecular characterization of tumors
