## Key Concepts

### I. PSYCHOSTIMULANTS

#### A. What is a Psychostimulant?

**Effects:**
- Excitement/euphoria
- Decreased fatigue
- Increased motor activity
- Sympathetic activation
- Increased metabolism

**Key Neurotransmitters/Receptors:**
- Norepinephrine
- Dopamine
- Serotonin
- Adenosine (Purines)
- Acetylcholine
- TAAR (Trace Amine-Associated Receptor)

---

### II. MONOAMINE NEUROTRANSMITTERS

#### A. Norepinephrine

**Biosynthesis:** Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine → Epinephrine

**Key Features:**
- Packaging: VMAT1 and VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporters)
- Termination: NET (norepinephrine transporter)
- Metabolism: MAO (monoamine oxidase) and COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase)
- Receptors: Alpha1, Alpha2, Beta1, Beta2 (all GPCRs)
- Functional role: Arousal/Attention

**Receptor Effects:**
- **Alpha-1:** Vasoconstriction, increased peripheral resistance, increased BP, mydriasis, bladder sphincter closure
- **Alpha-2:** Inhibits NE release, inhibits ACh and insulin release, platelet aggregation, but decreases BP due to decreased sympathetic outflow
- **Beta-1:** Increased heart rate, myocardial contractility, renin release
- **Beta-2:** Vasodilation, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis, glucagon release, uterine relaxation
- **Beta-3:** Lipolysis, thermogenesis, bladder detrusor relaxation

---

#### B. Dopamine

**Biosynthesis:** Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine

**Key Features:**
- Packaging: VMAT1 and VMAT2
- Termination: DAT (dopamine transporter)
- Metabolism: MAO and COMT
- Receptors: D1 family (Gs), D2 family (Gi)
- Functional role: Reward, Movement

**Major Pathways:**
1. **Mesolimbic Pathway:** VTA → Limbic System (reward, fear)
2. **Mesocortical Pathway:** VTA → Prefrontal Cortex (motor initiation, working memory, cognition)
3. **Nigrostriatal Pathway:** Substantia Nigra → Basal Ganglia (motor regulation)
4. Other pathways: Tuberoinfundibular (prolactin regulation), Hypothalamospinal (motor function)

**Dopamine Receptors:**
- **D1:** Renal vasodilation
- **D2:** Decreases prolactin, target of antipsychotics, implicated in Parkinson disease
- **D3:** Emotion, behavior (limbic system)
- **D4:** Cognition, behavior (frontal cortex)
- **D5:** Memory, learning (hippocampus, hypothalamus)

**Reward Prediction Error Hypothesis:**
Dopamine signals the difference between expected and actual outcomes. It primarily encodes learning, reinforcement, and motivation—not pleasure or euphoria—helping explain its central role in habit formation and addiction.

---

#### C. Serotonin (5-HT)

**Biosynthesis:** Tryptophan → 5-HTP (via decarboxylase)

**Key Features:**
- Packaging: VMAT1 and VMAT2
- Termination: SERT (serotonin reuptake transporter)
- Metabolism: MAO
- Receptors: 5HT1-7 isoforms (~13 subtypes), mostly GPCRs except 5HT3 (cation channel)
- Functional role: Happiness, libido, autonomic GI regulation

**Origins:** Raphe Nuclei in brainstem project to:
- Cortex/Thalamus (mood, attention, arousal, sleep/wake)
- Hypothalamus (sex drive, feeding behavior)
- Brainstem/Spinal Cord (autonomic regulation, breathing, pain)

**Key Receptor Functions:**
- **5-HT1:** Anxiety, depression, vasoconstriction, increased sexual function
- **5-HT2:** Hallucinations, platelet aggregation, decreased libido, delayed orgasm
- **5-HT3:** Nausea/vomiting
- **5-HT4:** Increased GI motility (prokinetic)

---

### III. SPECIFIC STIMULANTS

#### A. Cocaine

**Mechanism:** Nonselective monoamine reuptake inhibitor (blocks DAT, NET, SERT equally)

**Key Features:**
- Primarily a drug of abuse
- Clinical use: Local anesthetic with vasoconstrictive properties
- Also blocks sodium channels at higher concentrations
- Forms toxic metabolite benzoylecgonine
- Forms cocaethylene when combined with alcohol

---

#### B. Amphetamines (Phenylethylamines)

**Mechanism:** Multiple actions including:
1. Release monoamines from vesicular storage into cytosol
2. Reverse monoamine reuptake transporters (NET, DAT, SERT)
3. MAO inhibitor at high doses
4. Possible direct agonist at adrenoreceptors
5. Key difference from cocaine: Predominance of intracellular effects

**Specific Drugs:**
- **Amphetamine (racemic):** Mixed salts (Adderall)
- **Dextroamphetamine:** More CNS-selective, less peripheral effects
- **Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse):** Prodrug converted by RBC amidases; lower abuse potential
- **Methamphetamine:** Higher CNS:peripheral ratio; neurotoxic at high doses
- **MDMA:** SERT >> DAT/NET (unlike methamphetamine)

**Effects:**
- CNS: Wakefulness, improved reaction time, euphoria, psychosis, confusion, addiction
- Peripheral: Palpitations, hypertension, sweating, anorexia, GI symptoms

**Clinical Uses:**
1. Narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness (increased wakefulness)
2. ADHD (increased frontal lobe activity)
3. Depression augmentation (increased mood)
4. Weight loss/binge eating disorders (decreased appetite)

**ADHD Rationale:** ADHD involves frontal lobe hypoactivity and executive functioning deficits. Stimulants increase dopamine and norepinephrine in frontal cortex, improving attention and executive function.

**TAAR1 System:** Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1, discovered in 2001, is an intracellular GPCR that affects dopamine receptor trafficking and is implicated in amphetamine's effects in ADHD.

### IV. SEDATIVES AND HYPNOTICS

**Definitions:**
- **Sedative:** Agent that reduces anxiety
- **Hypnotic:** Agent that produces drowsiness

#### Anxiety Pathophysiology (Simplified)

Serotonin (5-HT) → GABA → Limbic System → SANS (Sympathetic Autonomic Nervous System)

Low serotonin or low GABA leads to increased limbic system activity and anxiety symptoms.

---

- Hypothermia
- Analgesia
- Bradycardia and hypotension (major component involves vagal activation)

---

#### B. GABA System

**GABA Overview:**
- Produced from glutamate via glutamic acid decarboxylase
- GAT1 is predominant GABA transporter
- 20% of CNS neurons are GABAergic
- Serves as transmitter at ~30% of synapses

**GABAA Receptor:** Ligand-gated chloride channel with multiple subunits (α, β, γ)

---

#### C. Benzodiazepines (BZDs)

**Mechanism:** Bind between α1-3, α5 and γ2 subunits; increase frequency of chloride channel opening

---

#### E. Sleep Physiology and Medications

**Sleep Regulation:**

Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) → VLPO (Ventrolateral Preoptic nucleus) → Inhibits arousal centers

Arousal centers: Tuberomammillary Nucleus, Lateral Hypothalamic Nucleus, Reticular Formation (release orexin and histamine)

**Insomnia Causes:**
1. Low melatonin
2. Low GABA
3. High orexin
4. High histamine

---

**Melatonin secretion:** High at night, low during day; regulated by pineal gland in response to light

---

#### G. Orexin Receptor Antagonists

**Mechanism:** Block OX1R/OX2R; orexin promotes wakefulness

**Background:** Loss of orexin-producing neurons is associated with narcolepsy

**Drugs:**

## Important Clinical Correlations

### ADHD Treatment
- Neural circuitry involves dysfunction in fronto-cerebellar, reward, fronto-striatal, executive function, and attentional networks
- Stimulants increase frontal lobe activity, improving executive function
- Can be augmented with α2 agonists like guanfacine

### Drug Comparisons

**Amphetamine vs. Cocaine:**

| Feature | Amphetamine | Cocaine |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Transporter action | Substrate → causes release | Blocker → inhibits reuptake |
| DAT/NET | Strong | Strong |
| SERT | Weak, indirect | Direct, meaningful |
| Mechanism | Enters neuron, disrupts VMAT2, reverses transport | Sits on transporter, prevents reuptake |
| Monoamine release | Active (pushes out) | Passive (prevents removal) |

### Special Considerations

**MAO Inhibitor Interactions:**
- Tyramine-containing foods (aged cheese, wine, cured meats) can cause hypertensive crisis
- High-dose amphetamines have MAO-inhibiting effects

**Tachyphylaxis:**
- Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine show tachyphylaxis via NE depletion
- Phenylephrine does not show tachyphylaxis

**Abuse Potential:**
- Lisdexamfetamine has lower abuse potential (cannot be snorted/injected effectively)
- Z-drugs have less abuse potential than benzodiazepines
- Modafinil has less abuse potential than amphetamines

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stimulants work primarily through monoamine systems** (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin), adenosine antagonism, or nicotinic receptor activation.

2. **ADHD treatment paradox:** Stimulants help ADHD by increasing frontal lobe activity in a condition characterized by frontal hypoactivity.

3. **Cocaine vs. Amphetamines:** Cocaine blocks reuptake; amphetamines cause active release and reverse transport.

4. **Benzodiazepines** are nonselective GABAA modulators with anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. They carry risks of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal.

5. **Z-drugs** are more selective for α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, making them more specific for sleep with less abuse potential.

6. **Sleep regulation** involves melatonin (circadian rhythm), GABA (inhibition of arousal), and orexin/histamine (wakefulness promotion).

7. **Multiple pathways to treat insomnia:** Increase melatonin signaling, increase GABA, decrease orexin, or decrease histamine.

8. **Flumazenil** can reverse both benzodiazepines and Z-drugs.

9. **Emerging threats:** Xylazine mixed with fentanyl causing severe withdrawal syndromes and tissue damage.
