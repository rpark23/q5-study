## 1. Neuromuscular Junction Physiology

### Acetylcholine Release Mechanism

The neuromuscular junction transmits signals from motor neurons to skeletal muscle through several steps:

1. **Action potential propagation**: Voltage-gated sodium channels propagate the signal along the nerve
2. **Calcium influx**: Voltage-gated calcium channels open, increasing intracellular calcium
3. **Vesicle fusion**: Calcium facilitates binding of SNARE protein complexes (syntaxin, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin) to release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft
4. **Receptor activation**: Acetylcholine binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle membrane
5. **Muscle depolarization**: Sodium influx and potassium efflux cause depolarization
6. **Calcium release**: Dihydropyridine channels (L-type calcium channels) open ryanodine receptors, releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
7. **Muscle contraction**: Calcium enables the sliding filament mechanism
8. **Repolarization**: Voltage-sensitive potassium channels allow potassium efflux
9. **Acetylcholine breakdown**: Acetylcholinesterase terminates the signal at the synapse; pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) degrades acetylcholine in plasma and liver

### SNARE Protein Complex

- **T-SNARE** (Q-SNARE): Syntaxin and SNAP-25
- **V-SNARE** (R-SNARE): Synaptobrevin, VAMPs, synaptotagmin
- VAMP = vesicle associated membrane proteins
- SNAP = synaptosomal associated membrane protein

## 2. Receptor Types: Nicotinic vs Muscarinic

### Nicotinic Receptors

- **Type**: Ligand-gated ion channel
- **Speed**: Fast (milliseconds)
- **Mechanism**: Sodium in / Potassium out → depolarization
- **Effect**: Always excitatory
- **Key drugs**: Neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine, rocuronium)

### Muscarinic Receptors

- **Type**: GPCR (G-protein coupled receptor)
- **Speed**: Slower (seconds)
- **Mechanism**: Second messenger signaling (Gi or Gq)
- **Effect**: Can be excitatory or inhibitory
- **Key drugs**: Antimuscarinics (atropine, glycopyrrolate), muscarinic agonists

### High-Yield Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes

**M1** (Gq) - CNS and ENS
- Increases CNS/ENS activity
- Increases gastric acid (indirect)
- Memory aid: "mind + motility"

**M2** (Gi) - Heart
- Decreases SA rate
- Decreases AV conduction

**M3** (Gq) - Glands, smooth muscle, eye, endothelium, sweat glands
- Increases secretions
- Bronchoconstriction
- Increases GI motility
- Detrusor contraction
- Miosis and accommodation
- Vasodilation via nitric oxide
- Memory aid: "makes you wet, constrict and pee"

## 3. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

### Depolarizing Blocker: Succinylcholine

**Mechanism**: Binds nicotinic receptors and causes sustained depolarization

**Adverse Effects**:
- Fasciculations (post-operative myalgia)
- Risk of hyperkalemia (especially in renal failure, immobility, burns)
- Malignant hyperthermia (in patients with RyR1 mutation)
- Prolonged paralysis in pseudocholinesterase deficiency

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes (metabolized by pseudocholinesterase)

**Reversal**: No specific reversal agent; must wait for metabolism

### Nondepolarizing Blockers

**Examples**: Rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, pancuronium

**Mechanism**: Competitive inhibitors at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

**Characteristics**:
- No fasciculations
- Differ in their pharmacokinetics
- Exhibit "fade" pattern on train-of-four monitoring

---

## 4. Reversal Strategies

### For Nondepolarizing Blockers

**Cholinesterase Inhibitors** (drive up acetylcholine to compete):
- Neostigmine
- Pyridostigmine
- Physostigmine

**Co-administration Required**: Because increasing acetylcholine affects muscarinic receptors throughout the body, must give muscarinic antagonist:
- Glycopyrrolate
- Atropine

**Sugammadex**:
- Binds steroidal nondepolarizing blockers (rocuronium, vecuronium)
- Direct binding agent that encapsulates the drug
- Complex is renally cleared
- Also binds oral hormonal contraceptives (important side effect)

## 5. Other Agents Affecting the Neuromuscular Junction

### Botulinum Toxin (Onabotulinum toxin A)

- Cleaves SNARE proteins (specifically targets synaptobrevin and SNAP-25)
- Prevents acetylcholine release
- Causes flaccid paralysis
- Inhibits release of other neurotransmitters (used for migraine)
- Types A and B have medical uses

### Organophosphates

**Examples**: Pesticides, insecticides, Sarin (chemical weapon)

**Mechanism**: Irreversibly block acetylcholinesterase, causing paralysis

**Treatment**:
- Pralidoxime (can regenerate acetylcholinesterase bound to sarin)
- Atropine (blocks muscarinic effects)

### Snake Venoms

- **α-Bungarotoxin**: Blocks nicotinic receptors
- **Dendrotoxins**: Block potassium channels

Envenomation is a major global health problem affecting 6 million people annually, with 150,000 deaths per year. Antivenom production remains challenging and region-specific.

### Tetanus Toxin

- Cleaves synaptobrevin at inhibitory interneurons
- Decreases GABA and glycine release
- Causes unopposed motor neuron activity
- Results in muscle spasm and rigidity

## 6. Other Muscle Relaxers

These agents work centrally and are used for pain (especially lower back pain), though evidence is limited:

**Baclofen**:
- GABA-B agonist (potassium channels)
- Decreases activity centrally/spinal cord
- Side effects: CNS depression, ataxia

**Tizanidine**:
- Alpha-2 agonist
- Inhibits presynaptic neurons
- Side effects: Sedation, CNS effects

**Cyclobenzaprine**:
- Tricyclic antidepressant-like effect

**Dantrolene**:
- Blocks ryanodine receptor 1
- NOT used for pain
- Used for malignant hyperthermia
- Side effects: Hepatotoxicity, weakness

**Benzodiazepines**:
- GABA-A agonist
- Increase activity of inhibitory interneurons

## 7. Medical Applications from Venoms

Nature has provided templates for important medications:

- **Brazilian Pit Viper** → Captopril (first ACE inhibitor)
- **Gila Monster** → Exenatide (GLP-1 agonist for diabetes)
- **Australian Funnel-Web Spider** → Hi1a (experimental: blocks acid sensing to prevent cell death in myocardial infarction)

## Historical Note

The lecture began with a tragic medication error case involving vecuronium (a paralytic) being mistaken for midazolam (Versed, a benzodiazepine), emphasizing the critical importance of medication safety. It also covered the history of curare, brought from Ecuador to the US by Richard Gill and introduced into anesthetic practice.
