## 3. Mechanism of Action

### Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels

Local anesthetics work by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), which are essential for nerve impulse transmission.

**Three States of Sodium Channels:**
1. **Resting State** (closed) - channel ready to open
2. **Activated State** (open) - Na+ influx occurs
3. **Inactivated State** (closed) - channel cannot reopen immediately

### How Local Anesthetics Work

**Key Principle:** Local anesthetics must enter the cell to work

1. **Unionized form** diffuses through cell membrane
2. Inside the cell, converted to **ionized form** by lower intracellular pH
3. Ionized form binds to intracellular binding site on the sodium channel
4. Higher affinity for **inactivated conformations**
5. Push channel to stay in inactive state - **use-dependent blockade**

**Important Note:** Tetrodotoxin (pufferfish toxin) binds from outside, but local anesthetics work from inside.

### Multiple Sodium Channel Subtypes

There are 9 different sodium channel subtypes (Nav1.1 - Nav1.9) with different:
- Tissue distributions
- Activation thresholds
- Inactivation kinetics
- Sensitivity to blockade

This provides multiple potential drug targets for future selective local anesthetics.

### Other Targets

Local anesthetics also bind and inhibit:
- **Channels:** Ca, K
- **Enzymes:** Adenylyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, lipases
- **Receptors:** Nicotinic acetylcholine, NMDA, β2-adrenergic
- May have anti-inflammatory properties

These effects are important for systemic effects and neuraxial administration.

## 4. Chemical Structure and Classification

### Common Structure
**Aromatic Ring + Intermediate Chain + Tertiary Amine**

The intermediate chain determines classification:

### Amides
- Intermediate chain contains **NHCO** (amide bond)
- Names contain **"i"** before "-caine"
- Examples: Lidocaine, Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine, Mepivacaine, Levobupivacaine, Prilocaine

### Esters
- Intermediate chain contains **COOR** (ester bond)
- No "i" before "-caine"
- Examples: Cocaine, Benzocaine, Procaine, Chloroprocaine, Tetracaine

**The Rule of "I":** If there's an "i" before "-caine," it's an amide.

---

## 5. Metabolism

### Amides
- **Hepatic metabolism** (liver)
- Plasma concentration can accumulate with repeated doses
- Toxicity is dose-related and can be **delayed** from initial dosing
- Important in patients with liver dysfunction

### Esters
- **Plasma metabolism** by pseudocholinesterase
- Don't tend to accumulate
- Rapid breakdown
- Important in pseudocholinesterase deficiency

---

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology

### Key Factors Affecting Clinical Use

1. **Differential block and use dependence**
2. **Potency**
3. **Speed of onset**
4. **Duration of action**
5. **Toxicity**

### Potency

**Determined by lipid solubility**
- More lipophilic = penetrates lipid membrane better = higher potency
- More protein binding also correlates with potency

**Clinical Relevance:**
- High potency drugs (bupivacaine, ropivacaine) = 0.2-0.5% concentrations
- Low potency drugs (lidocaine, procaine) = 1-2% concentrations

### Speed of Onset

**Two main factors:**

**1. Dose** - Higher concentration = more molecules available

**2. pKa** - Critical determinant of onset speed

**Understanding pKa:**
- pKa is the pH at which 50% is ionized and 50% is unionized
- Local anesthetics are weak bases
- At physiological pH (7.4):
  - If pH < pKa → more ionized (BH+, charged)
  - If pH > pKa → more unionized (B, uncharged)
- **Only unionized form crosses membrane**

**pKa and Onset Times:**

| Local Anesthetic | pKa | Onset |
|------------------|-----|-------|
| Chloroprocaine | ~8.7 | Very fast (high dose compensates) |
| Mepivacaine | ~7.6 | Fast |
| Lidocaine | ~7.9 | Fast |
| Prilocaine | ~7.9 | Fast |
| Bupivacaine | ~8.1 | Moderate-slow |
| Levobupivacaine | ~8.1 | Moderate-slow |
| Ropivacaine | ~8.1 | Moderate-slow |
| Tetracaine | ~8.5 | Slow |

**Clinical Application:**

**Why are local anesthetics less effective in infected tissue?**
- Infected tissue has lower pH (acidic environment)
- Lower pH shifts equilibrium toward ionized form
- Less unionized drug available to cross membrane
- **Solution:** Add sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to increase pH and speed onset

### Duration of Action

**Multiple factors:**

1. **Protein binding** - how long drug sticks to receptor
2. **Systemic absorption** - affected by:
   - Tissue vascularity
   - Use of vasoconstrictors (epinephrine)
3. **Dose** - higher dose lasts longer
4. **Rate of elimination** - especially important for esters

**Duration Categories:**
- **Short:** Procaine, chloroprocaine
- **Intermediate:** Lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine
- **Long-acting:** Tetracaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine

## 7. Local Anesthetic Toxicity

### LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity)

Toxicity follows a predictable progression:

### CNS Toxicity (Usually First)
Early warning signs:
- Tinnitus
- Dizziness, lightheadedness
- Perioral numbness
- Metallic taste

Progressive symptoms:
- Anxiety → Confusion → Loss of consciousness → Seizure → Respiratory arrest

### Cardiac Toxicity
- Hypotension (all local anesthetics are negative inotropes)
- Arrhythmias:
  - PVCs → Wide QRS → Ventricular tachycardia → Ventricular fibrillation
  - OR bradycardia → asystole

**Special Note on Bupivacaine:**
- Rapid transition from CNS to cardiac toxicity
- High preference for cardiac tissue
- Pregnancy enhances risk of cardiac toxic effects

### Treatment of LAST

**Airway Management:**
- Maintain 100% oxygenation
- Intubate if necessary

**CNS:**
- Treat seizures with benzodiazepines

**Cardiac:**
- Consider ECMO for refractory cardiac arrest
- Amiodarone for arrhythmias
- Probably NOT best to use lidocaine (another local anesthetic)

**Key Treatment: INTRALIPID**
- 20% lipid emulsion
- Creates a "lipid sink" to pull lipophilic local anesthetic out of tissues
- Life-saving treatment for severe LAST

### Neurotoxicity
- Direct nerve damage possible with high concentrations
- Transient neurologic symptoms
- More common with certain agents and techniques

### Allergic Reactions

**Amides (most commonly used):**
- True allergy is exceedingly rare
- Most "allergic" reactions are:
  - Vasovagal responses ("I passed out")
  - Epinephrine effects ("heart races")
  - Reactions to preservatives:
    - **Methylparaben** (in multidose vials)
    - **Metabisulfites** (prevent oxidation of epinephrine in dental cartridges)

**Esters:**
- More likely to cause true allergic reactions
- Metabolize to **PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid)** which can cause allergies
- PABA is the same moiety as methylparaben

**Special Consideration:**
- **Benzocaine** can cause methemoglobinemia (not an allergy)
- Treatment: Methylene blue

## 8. Problems and Future Directions

### Current Limitations

1. **Duration limited to ~24 hours maximum**
   - Continuous infusions via catheters needed for longer duration
   - Requires monitoring and setup

2. **Unpredictable duration**
   - Great person-to-person variability
   - Difficult to predict exact block duration

3. **Non-selective sodium channel blockade**
   - Blocks all nerve fiber types

### Future Developments

- **Extended-release formulations** (e.g., Exparel - liposomal bupivacaine)
- **Sodium channel subtype-selective drugs**
  - Targeting pain-specific channels (Nav1.7, Nav1.8, Nav1.9)
  - Would allow sensory block without motor block
- **Novel delivery systems**

## Key Pharmacology Summary

**Remember the key relationships:**

| Property | Determines | Clinical Effect |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Lipid solubility** | Potency | Higher lipid solubility = higher potency = lower concentration needed |
| **pKa** | Speed of onset | pKa closer to 7.4 = faster onset |
| **Protein binding** | Duration | Higher protein binding = longer duration |
| **Chemical linkage** | Metabolism | Amide vs Ester determines route of elimination |

---

## Clinical Pearls

1. **Amide or Ester?** Use the "i" rule - if there's an "i" before "-caine," it's an amide
2. **Infected tissue?** Add bicarbonate to speed onset
3. **Long surgery?** Choose bupivacaine or ropivacaine
4. **Fast onset needed?** Choose lidocaine or mepivacaine
5. **Liver disease?** Be cautious with amides (accumulation risk)
6. **Pseudocholinesterase deficiency?** Avoid esters
7. **Pregnancy?** Extra caution with bupivacaine (cardiac toxicity risk)
8. **LAST treatment?** Have intralipid readily available
