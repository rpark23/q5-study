# Lecture 08: Local Anesthetics

## Mechanism of Action

- Block **voltage-gated Na+ channels** from the **intracellular side**
- Exception: **Tetrodotoxin** (from puffer fish) blocks from extracellular side
- Bind to **open channel** state
- 10 human genes for voltage-gated Na+ channels

## Pharmacokinetics

| Property | Determinant | Clinical Relevance |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Speed of onset** | pKa | Lower pKa = faster onset (more unionized at physiologic pH) |
| **Potency** | Lipid solubility | Higher lipophilicity = greater potency |
| **Duration** | Protein binding | Higher protein binding = longer duration |

### pH and Efficacy
- Local anesthetics are **weak bases** with pKa > 7.4
- **Less effective in infected tissue** (more acidic environment protonates the anesthetic, reducing membrane crossing)
- Example: Lidocaine (pKa 7.8) has **faster onset** than bupivacaine (pKa 8.1) at physiologic pH 7.4

## Classification: Esters vs Amides

| Type | Naming Rule | Metabolism | Examples |
|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Ester** | No "i" before "-caine" | Plasma pseudocholinesterase | Cocaine, Procaine, Tetracaine |
| **Amide** | Has "i" before "-caine" (amIde = I) | Hepatic (liver) | Lidocaine, Bupivacaine, Prilocaine |

## Nerve Fiber Types & Sensitivity

| Fiber Type | Function | Sensitivity to Block |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **B fibers** | Autonomic preganglionic | Highest |
| **C fibers** | Unmyelinated, dull pain from skin/viscera | High |
| **A-delta** | Nociception and cold | High |
| **A-beta** | Tactile sensation | Moderate |
| **A-gamma** | Muscle spindles | Moderate |
| **A-alpha** | Skeletal muscle (motor) | Lowest |

**Differential blockade sensitivity**: Neuraxial sympathetic > Pain > Touch > Motor

### Why More Selective to Nociception?
- Pain fibers (C and A-delta) fire more frequently
- Use-dependent blockade preferentially affects rapidly firing neurons

## Genetic Conditions

| Condition | Mechanism | Phenotype |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Congenital insensitivity to pain** | Loss of NaV 1.7 function | Painless |
| **Erythromelalgia** | Gain of NaV 1.7 function | Intense burning pain, severe skin redness |

## Adverse Effects & Toxicity

### Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)
**Presentation**: Perioral numbness, tinnitus, agitation, confusion → seizures → cardiac arrest

**Treatment**:
1. Seizure management
2. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)
3. **20% lipid emulsion** (rapidly increases volume of distribution, moves anesthetic off binding sites in CNS and myocardium)

### Prilocaine-Specific
- Creates **O-toluidine** → oxidizes hemoglobin → **methemoglobinemia**

## Adjuvants

| Adjuvant | Mechanism | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Epinephrine** | Vasoconstriction | Reduces drug washaway, prolongs duration |

---

## Key Drug Facts

| Drug | Key Points |
|------|------------|
| **Lidocaine** | pKa 7.8, fast onset, amide |
| **Bupivacaine** | pKa 8.1, slower onset, longer duration |
| **Prilocaine** | Risk of methemoglobinemia |
