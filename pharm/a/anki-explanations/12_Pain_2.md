# Lecture 12: Pain 2 - Glutamate Receptors & Cannabinoids

## Glutamate Receptors

Glutamate = main excitatory neurotransmitter in CNS

### Three Main Receptor Types

| Receptor | Ion Permeability | Key Features |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **AMPA** | Na+ and K+ | Fast excitatory transmission |
| **Kainate** | Na+ and K+ | Modulatory role |
| **NMDA** | Ca2+, Na+, and K+ | Requires 3 conditions for activation |

### NMDA Receptor Activation Requirements
1. **Glutamate binding**
2. **Glycine binding** (co-agonist)
3. **Strong depolarization** to expel Mg2+ block

### NMDA Location
- Brain and spinal cord

## NMDA Receptor Antagonists

| Drug | Use | Mechanism | Notes |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Ketamine** | Anesthetic, chronic neuropathic pain, **depression** | Non-competitive NMDA antagonist | Dissociative anesthetic |
| **Memantine** | Alzheimer's disease | Non-competitive NMDA antagonist | Moderate efficacy, few adverse effects |
| **Amantadine** | Parkinson's disease | Increases dopamine in CNS | Helps bradykinetic symptoms |
| **Dextromethorphan** | Cough syrup | Weak NMDA antagonist + weak opioid agonist | OTC medication |

## Cannabinoid System

### Receptors
| Receptor | Coupled to | Effect |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **CB1** | Gi GPCR | Decreases cAMP |
| **CB2** | Gi GPCR | Decreases cAMP |

### Endocannabinoids
- **Anandamide**
- **2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol)**
- Function: Regulate homeostasis

### Physiologic Effects of Cannabinoid Receptor Activation
1. Euphoria
2. Appetite stimulation
3. Psychosis
4. Addiction/dependence
5. Impaired memory
6. **Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome**

## Cannabinoid Drugs (US Approved)

| Drug | Description | FDA Indications |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Dronabinol** | Purified THC | Wasting disease/appetite (AIDS), refractory chemotherapy-induced vomiting |
| **Nabilone** | Synthetic cannabinoid | Antiemetic |
| **CBD (Cannabidiol)** | Non-psychoactive | Seizures (Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) |

### Not US Approved
- **Nabiximol** - Mouth spray for MS spasticity, neuropathic pain, overactive bladder

## Summary Table: Pain Modulators

| Drug Class | Mechanism | Clinical Use |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| NMDA antagonists | Block glutamate signaling | Anesthesia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, pain |
| Cannabinoids | CB1/CB2 agonism → decreased cAMP | Appetite, antiemetic, seizures |
