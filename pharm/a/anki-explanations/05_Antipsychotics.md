# Lecture 05: Antipsychotics

## Schizophrenia

### Dopamine Hypothesis
**Excessive dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic system**

### Symptoms of Schizophrenia

| Positive Symptoms | Negative Symptoms |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Thought disorders | Amotivation |
| Delusions | Social withdrawal |
| Hallucinations | Flat affect |
| Paranoia | Poverty of speech |

---

## Antipsychotic Terminology

**Archaic terms:**
- Major tranquilizer
- Neuroleptic

## Antipsychotic Classes

### First Generation (Typicals)
| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **MOA** | Dopamine (D2) antagonists |
| **Side Effects** | More likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects |

### Second Generation (Atypicals)
| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Current Use** | Most common antipsychotics in current use |
| **Prototype** | **Clozapine** |
| **Examples** | Clozapine, Olanzapine, Risperidone |
| **Advantage** | Less likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects |

---

## Extrapyramidal Side Effects (EPS)

Movement disorders caused by D2 blockade:
- **Akathisia** (restlessness, inability to sit still)
- **Acute dystonias** (sustained muscle contractions)
- **Parkinsonism** (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia)

## Summary Table

| Generation | Name | MOA | Examples | EPS Risk |
|------------|------|-----|----------|----------|
| **1st (Typical)** | Typicals | D2 antagonist | Haloperidol | Higher |
| **2nd (Atypical)** | Atypicals | D2 + other receptors | Clozapine, Olanzapine, Risperidone | Lower |

## Key Points

1. **Dopamine hypothesis:** Schizophrenia = excessive DA in mesolimbic system
2. **Positive symptoms** (additions to normal): hallucinations, delusions, paranoia
3. **Negative symptoms** (subtractions from normal): flat affect, amotivation, social withdrawal
4. **Atypicals preferred** due to lower EPS risk
5. **Clozapine** = prototypical atypical antipsychotic
