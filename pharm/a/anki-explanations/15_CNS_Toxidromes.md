# Lecture 15: CNS Toxidromes

## Toxicology Testing

| Method | Detects | Pros | Cons |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| **Urine immunoassay** | Amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, some opiates, PCP, TCAs, THC | Fast, common | Limited panel, misses synthetics |
| **Gas chromatography-mass spec** | Wide range | Highly sensitive and specific | Slow |

**Note**: Synthetic opioids (fentanyl) often NOT detected on standard urine drug screens

## Opioid Toxidrome

### Overdose
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **State** | Sedated |
| **Time Course** | Rapid with overdose |
| **Key Symptoms** | Miosis (pinpoint pupils), respiratory depression, hypotension, sedation, cold/clammy skin |
| **Late Signs** | Loss of consciousness → respiratory failure → death |
| **Treatment** | **Naloxone** |

### Withdrawal
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **State** | Agitated |
| **Time Course** | Days of abstinence |
| **Early Signs** | Anxiety, **yawning**, sweating, **lacrimation**, hyperactive bowel sounds, pain |
| **Late Signs** | Fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, muscle spasms ("kicking the habit"), tachycardia, mydriasis (dilated pupils), piloerection |
| **Treatment** | α2 agonists (clonidine), replacement opiates (buprenorphine, methadone) |

## Anticholinergic Syndrome

### Sources
**Natural**: Jimson weed, some mushrooms (*Amanita muscaria*)
**Drugs**: Antihistamines, TCAs, antipsychotics, antiparkinson drugs

### Clinical Picture
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **State** | Agitated |
| **Time Course** | Minutes to hours after drug |
| **Key Symptoms** | **Dry** skin, agitation, delirium, **dilated pupils**, tachycardia, urinary retention, hyperthermia |

### Mnemonic - "Hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, mad as a hatter"

### Treatment
| Cause | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| Plant toxins | **Physostigmine** (AChE inhibitor) |
| TCAs | Manage symptoms (physostigmine risks cardiac toxicity in TCA OD) |

**Physostigmine risks**: Seizures, bradycardia, heart block, asystole
**High risk with TCA OD**: Look for wide QRS on ECG

## Stimulant Syndrome

### Causes
- Cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, synthetic cannabinoids

### Clinical Picture
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **State** | Agitated |
| **Time Course** | Minutes to hours after drug |
| **Key Symptoms** | Hypertension, tachycardia, agitation/psychosis, increased motor activity, **sweating**, dilated pupils |

### Treatment
| Symptom | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Agitation | Benzodiazepines |
| Psychosis | Antipsychotics |
| Seizures | Barbiturates + propofol |
| Hypertension | Beta blockers |
| Rhabdomyolysis | IV fluids |
| Hyperthermia | Cooling |

## Phencyclidine (PCP) Intoxication

### Mechanism
- **NMDA antagonist**

### Clinical Picture
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **State** | Agitated |
| **Time Course** | Minutes to hours after drug |
| **Key Symptoms** | **Vertical nystagmus** (pathognomonic), aggression, hallucinations, hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils |

### Treatment
- Same as stimulant syndrome
- Benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, supportive care

---

## Ethanol Withdrawal

### Mechanism
- Loss of chronic **GABA agonism** → CNS hyperexcitability

### Clinical Picture
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **State** | Agitated |
| **Time Course** | Within days of abstinence |
| **Key Symptoms** | **Formication** (bugs crawling), negative UTox, diaphoretic, tremulous |
| **Late (Delirium Tremens)** | Tachycardia, HTN, fever, delirium, hallucinations |

### Treatment
- **Benzodiazepines**
- **Thiamine**

## Toxidrome Comparison Table

| Toxidrome | State | Key Features | Pupils | Skin | Treatment |
|-----------|-------|--------------|--------|------|-----------|
| **Opioid OD** | Sedated | Resp depression | Miosis | Cold/clammy | Naloxone |
| **Opioid WD** | Agitated | Yawning, lacrimation | Mydriasis | Piloerection | α2 agonists, buprenorphine |
| **Anticholinergic** | Agitated | Dry, delirium | Mydriasis | **Dry**, hot | Physostigmine |
| **Stimulant** | Agitated | HTN, psychosis | Mydriasis | **Sweating** | Benzos, supportive |
| **PCP** | Agitated | **Vertical nystagmus** | Mydriasis | Sweating | Benzos, supportive |
| **EtOH WD** | Agitated | Formication, tremor | Normal/mydriasis | Diaphoretic | Benzos, thiamine |

## Quick Differentiation Tips

| Finding | Suggests |
|---------|----------|
| **Pinpoint pupils** | Opioid overdose |
| **Vertical nystagmus** | PCP |
| **Dry skin** | Anticholinergic |
| **Wet/sweating** | Sympathomimetic, withdrawal states |
| **Yawning + lacrimation** | Opioid withdrawal |
| **Formication** | Alcohol withdrawal |
