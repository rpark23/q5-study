# Lecture 14: Occupational Toxicology

## Lead Poisoning

### Sources & Exposure
- Absorption via **respiratory tract, GI tract**, poorly through skin
- At-risk populations: Children in old housing, occupational exposure, contaminated water

### Mechanism
- Interrupts **heme synthesis** by inhibiting:
  - **ALA-dehydratase** (porphobilinogen synthase)
  - **Ferrochelatase**
  - ALA synthetase
- Reduces RBC survival

### Clinical Features - **LEAD**
| Letter | Symptom |
|--------|---------|
| **L** | Lead lines on gingiva AND on metaphysis of long bones (X-ray) |
| **E** | Encephalopathy |
| **A** | Abdominal colic + Sideroblastic anemia |
| **D** | Drops - wrist drop and foot drop (peripheral neuropathy) |

### Lab Findings
- **Basophilic stippling** on blood smear

### Treatment
- **Chelation therapy** (EDTA, Succimer, Dimercaprol)
- Chelating agents form complex with heavy metals → unavailable for toxic interactions with enzymes/proteins

## Mercury Poisoning

### Environmental Sources (5)
1. Coal-fired power plants
2. Artisanal gold mining
3. Dental amalgams
4. Contaminated fish
5. Industrial processes

### Forms
- Elemental mercury (liquid)
- Inorganic mercury salts
- Organic mercury (methylmercury) - most toxic, bioaccumulates

---

## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

### Mechanism
- CO binds hemoglobin with 200x affinity of O2
- Shifts O2-Hb dissociation curve LEFT
- Impairs O2 delivery to tissues

### Treatment
- **Remove from exposure**
- **High-flow 100% O2**
- Consider hyperbaric oxygen for severe cases

---

## Benzene

### Exposure
- Most common source: **Gasoline** (higher concentrations in colder climates)

### Toxicity
| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Acute** | CNS depression |
| **Chronic** | Bone marrow injury/suppression → aplastic anemia, leukemia |

## Organophosphorus Pesticides

### Mechanism
- **Acetylcholinesterase inhibition** via phosphorylation of the esteratic site
- Results in cholinergic crisis

### Clinical Features (Cholinergic Toxidrome)
- **SLUDGE**: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI distress, Emesis
- **DUMBBELSS**: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Bronchospasm, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation, Sweating

### Treatment
1. **Atropine** - blocks muscarinic effects
2. **Pralidoxime (2-PAM)** - cholinesterase reactivator (must give early before "aging")

---

## Organochlorine Pesticides

### Most Famous
- **DDT** (chlorophenothane)

### Toxicity
- **Endocrine disruption** in animals and humans
- Persistent environmental pollutant
- Bioaccumulates in food chain

---

## Alcohol Withdrawal

### Mechanism
- Loss of chronic GABA agonism → CNS hyperexcitability

### Clinical Picture

| Phase | Symptoms |
|-------|----------|
| **Early** | Anxiety, insomnia, tremor, palpitations, nausea, **seizures**, hallucinations |
| **Late (Delirium Tremens)** | Tachycardia, hypertension, fever, tremor, diaphoresis, delirium, agitation, formication (bugs crawling on skin) |

### Treatment
- **Benzodiazepines**
- **Thiamine** (prevent Wernicke encephalopathy)

## Toxicology Testing

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Urine immunoassay** | Fast, cheap, detects common drugs | False positives/negatives, limited panel |
| **Gas chromatography-mass spec (GC-MS)** | Highly sensitive and specific | Slow, expensive |
