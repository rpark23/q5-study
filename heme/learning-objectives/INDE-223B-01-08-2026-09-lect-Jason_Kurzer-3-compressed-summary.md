## Complete Blood Count Overview

### Purpose
The CBC is a **screening test** that provides information about overall health by evaluating peripheral blood cellular components:
- Red blood cells (erythrocytes)
- White blood cells (leukocytes)
- Platelets (thrombocytes)

### CBC Components

**Red Blood Cell Parameters**:
- Red blood cell count (concentration)
- Hemoglobin concentration
- Hematocrit (packed cell volume)
- Mean cell volume (MCV)
- Red cell distribution width (RDW)
- Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH)
- Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)
- Reticulocyte count

**White Blood Cell Parameters**:
- White blood cell count (concentration)
- White blood cell differential (subsets)

**Platelet Parameters**:
- Platelet concentration

### Automated Cell Counting
- Modern laboratories use **automated hematology instruments**
- Count tens of thousands of cells per sample
- More accurate and precise than manual counting
- Rapid turnaround time
- May require human review for abnormal findings

## Red Blood Cell Parameters

### Parameters Assessing Anemia or Polycythemia

**Three Key Parameters** provide information about oxygen-delivering capacity:

**1. Hematocrit (Hct)**
- Volume of whole blood occupied by red blood cells
- Measured as packed cell volume after centrifugation
- Normal values:
  - Adult male: 42-52%
  - Adult female: 36-46%
- Decreased hematocrit → anemia
- Increased hematocrit → polycythemia
- Changes with age (highest at birth, decreases in infancy, returns to adult levels)

**2. Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)**
- Concentration of red blood cells (10¹²/L or 10⁶/µL)
- Normal values:
  - Adult male: 4.5-5.5 × 10¹²/L
  - Adult female: 4.0-5.0 × 10¹²/L
- Too few → suggestive of anemia
- Too many → suggestive of polycythemia
- RBC lifespan: 120 days
- Production: ~2.08 × 10¹¹ cells per day
- Diurnal variation (highest in AM, lowest in PM)

**3. Hemoglobin Concentration (Hgb)**
- Amount of hemoglobin per deciliter (g/dL)
- Normal values:
  - Adult male: 14.0-17.4 g/dL
  - Adult female: 12.0-16.0 g/dL
- Decreased hemoglobin → anemia
- Primary laboratory value for defining anemia
- With ~15 g/dL Hgb and 50 dL blood volume: 750 g total hemoglobin
- Loss rate: 0.125 g/dL per day (in absence of production)

### Red Blood Cell Morphology

**Normal RBC Characteristics**:
- Biconcave disc shape (~7.5 µm diameter)
- Can maneuver through spaces of 4 µm
- Lacks nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes
- Ideal for gas transfer
- Central pallor (1/3 of cell)
- Red/pink cytoplasm when stained

**Shape and Flexibility**:
- Dependent on membrane and cytoskeleton
- Allows passage through microcirculation
- Defects lead to abnormal shapes (poikilocytosis)

### Poikilocytosis (Variation in Cell Shape)

**Spiculated Cells**:

*Acanthocytes (Spur Cells)*:
- 2-20 irregularly spaced, irregularly shaped sharp projections
- Caused by alterations in lipid/protein ratio in membrane
- Seen in: liver disease, abetalipoproteinemia, McLeod syndrome, post-splenectomy, MDS

*Echinocytes (Burr Cells)*:
- 10-30 blunted, regularly spaced and shaped projections
- Increased outer lipid monolayer relative to inner layer
- Seen in: uremia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, pH increases, ATP depletion, dehydration

**Fragmented Cells**:

*Schistocytes*:
- Red cell fragments lacking central pallor
- Caused by shearing/mechanical damage in microcirculation
- Seen in: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
- Shapes include crescents, helmet cells, keratocytes

**Abnormal Hemoglobin Cells**:

*Sickle Cells*:
- Elongated red cells with tapered edges
- Caused by polymerization of hemoglobin S
- Irregular crescent or sickled shapes with pointed ends
- Seen in: sickle cell anemia

**Membrane Defects**:

*Spherocytes*:
- Small circular red cells (<6.5 µm) lacking central pallor
- Seen in: hereditary spherocytosis, hemolytic anemia (immune-mediated, microangiopathic, oxidative)
- Result from partial removal of plasma membrane

*Elliptocytes*:
- Elongated red cells (long axis >2× short axis)
- Seen in: hereditary elliptocytosis, diseases causing abnormal RBC production

**Oxidative Damage**:

*Bite Cells*:
- Peripheral arcuate removal of membrane (bite appearance)
- Caused by removal of Heinz bodies by splenic macrophages
- Seen in: oxidative hemolysis

*Blister Cells*:
- Cleared-out section of cytoplasm
- Precipitated hemoglobin retracted to one edge
- Seen in: oxidative hemolysis

**Other Poikilocytes**:

*Target Cells (Codocytes)*:
- Area of increased staining inside central pallor
- Increased membrane to cytoplasmic volume ratio
- Seen in: obstructive jaundice, sickle cell disease, hemoglobin C disease, liver disease, iron deficiency

*Tear Drop Cells (Dacrocytes)*:
- Pear-shaped red cells
- Seen in: bone marrow fibrosis, severe dyserythropoiesis, megaloblastic anemia, thalassemia major

### Red Blood Cell Size

**Mean Cell Volume (MCV)**
- Average volume of individual erythrocytes (femtoliters, fL)
- Normal values: 80-100 fL
- Used to categorize anemias:
  - **Microcytic**: MCV <80 fL
  - **Normocytic**: MCV 80-100 fL
  - **Macrocytic**: MCV >100 fL

**MCV-Based Approach to Anemia**:

*Microcytic Anemias*:
- Iron deficiency
- Anemia of inflammation
- Thalassemias
- Sideroblastic anemia (congenital)
- Sometimes lead poisoning

*Normocytic Anemias*:
- Appropriate response (hemorrhagic, hemolysis)
- Systemic disease (renal, liver, inflammation)
- Marrow impairment (aplasia, leukemia, myeloma)

*Macrocytic Anemias*:
- Megaloblastic (B12 deficiency, folate deficiency)
- Non-megaloblastic (increased reticulocytes, alcohol, liver disease, MDS, acquired sideroblastic)

**Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)**
- Measures variation in cell size (anisocytosis)
- RDW-CV: Coefficient of variation of MCV
- Normal: 12-14.6%
- Increased RDW → increased variation in cell size
- Helps differentiate causes of anemia:
  - Iron deficiency: markedly elevated RDW
  - Heterozygous beta thalassemia: normal RDW

### Hemoglobin Content Parameters

**Mean Cell Hemoglobin (MCH)**
- Average weight of hemoglobin per red blood cell (picograms, pg)
- Normal: 28-34 pg/cell
- Calculated: Hgb (g/dL) × 10 / RBC (×10¹²/L)
- Close to solubility limit of hemoglobin

**Mean Cell Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)**
- Average concentration of hemoglobin per red cell volume (g/dL)
- Normal: 32-36 g/dL
- Calculated: Hgb (g/dL) / Hct (L/L)
- Correlates with "chromia" seen on smear:
  - **Hypochromic**: MCHC <32 g/dL (>1/3 central pallor)
  - **Normochromic**: MCHC 32-36 g/dL
  - **Hyperchromic**: MCHC >36 g/dL (rare, usually artifact or spherocytes)

### The Rule of Three

For normal erythrocytes:
- **RBC count × 3 ≈ Hemoglobin**
- **Hemoglobin × 3 ≈ Hematocrit**
- Values should be correct within ±3%
- If not, may indicate instrument error or pathologic RBC issues
- Essentially a shorthand: normal MCH and MCHC ≈ 33

### Calculated Hematocrit
Most automated instruments calculate hematocrit:
- **Hct (L/L) = MCV (fL) × RBC count (×10¹²/L) / 1000**
- **Hct (%) = MCV (fL) × RBC count (×10¹²/L) / 10**

## White Blood Cell Parameters

### White Blood Cell Count (WBC)

**Definition**: Count of circulating nucleated cells (except nucleated erythrocytes)

**Normal Values**:
- Newborn: 9.0-30.0 × 10³/µL
- 6 months: 6.0-18.0 × 10³/µL
- 4 years: 4.5-13.5 × 10³/µL
- Adults: 4.5-11.0 × 10³/µL

**Terminology**:
- Increased leukocytes: **leukocytosis**
- Decreased leukocytes: **leukopenia**
- Neoplasm of WBCs circulating in blood: **leukemia**

**Characteristics**:
- Screening test altered by reactive and neoplastic causes
- Diurnal variation (lowest AM, highest PM)
- May be increased in infection, inflammation, drugs, or neoplastic expansion
- Sites of infection/inflammation attract leukocytes out of circulation

### White Blood Cell Differential

**Purpose**: Enumeration of leukocyte subtypes to identify which subtype affects total WBC count

**Methods**:

*Automated Instruments*:
- 5-6 part differential
- Neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils
- Some report immature granulocytes
- Fast and precise

*Manual Differential*:
- Microscopic examination of peripheral blood smear
- Counts 100-200 cells (less precise but allows detailed morphology)
- Can identify atypical cells not reported by automated instruments:
  - Blasts
  - Band neutrophils
  - Atypical lymphocytes
- May use digital scanning with software pre-classification

**Important**: Use **absolute counts** (not percentages) to identify cytopenias or cytoses
- Absolute count = WBC count × percentage of cell type

### The 5 Main Leukocytes

**1. Neutrophils (Segmented)**

*Morphology*:
- Segmented nucleus (2-5 lobes)

- Two pools: circulating (freely floating) and marginated (along vessel walls)
- Adrenaline/exercise mobilizes marginated pool
- Normal absolute count:
  - Adults: 1.5-5.0 × 10³/µL
  - Changes with age (relative percentage decreases in first months, increases around 4 years)

**2. Lymphocytes**

*Characteristics*:
- Normal absolute count:
  - Adults: 0-0.4 × 10³/µL

**5. Basophils**

---

## Key Clinical Concepts

### Identifying Cytopenias and Cytoses

**Red Blood Cells**:
- Anemia: decreased Hgb, Hct, and/or RBC count
- Polycythemia: increased Hgb, Hct, and/or RBC count

**White Blood Cells**:
- Leukopenia: decreased WBC count
- Leukocytosis: increased WBC count
- Must evaluate differential to determine which cell type is affected
- Use absolute counts, not percentages

**Platelets**:
- Thrombocytopenia: decreased platelet count (<150 × 10⁹/µL)
- Thrombocytosis: increased platelet count (>400 × 10⁹/µL)

### Characterizing Anemias

**By Size (MCV)**:
- Microcytic: problems with hemoglobin production (iron, heme, globin synthesis)
- Normocytic: destruction, loss, or decreased production
- Macrocytic: megaloblastic (impaired DNA synthesis) or non-megaloblastic

**By Hemoglobin Content (MCHC)**:
- Hypochromic: inadequate hemoglobin per cell (iron deficiency, thalassemia)
- Normochromic: normal hemoglobin content
- Hyperchromic: rare (spherocytes or artifact)

**By Cell Size Variation (RDW)**:
- Elevated RDW suggests heterogeneous population
- Helpful in distinguishing iron deficiency (high RDW) from thalassemia trait (normal RDW)

### Recognizing Poikilocytes

**Clinical Significance**:
- Provides clues to underlying diagnosis
- Acanthocytes → liver disease
- Schistocytes → microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
- Sickle cells → sickle cell disease
- Spherocytes → hereditary spherocytosis or hemolytic anemia
- Bite/blister cells → oxidative hemolysis
- Target cells → hemoglobinopathies, liver disease, iron deficiency
- Tear drops → myelofibrosis, dyserythropoiesis

### Interpreting the Differential

**Neutrophilia**:
- Infection, inflammation, stress
- Myeloproliferative neoplasms (if extreme)

**Lymphocytosis**:
- Viral infections (reactive)
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (neoplastic)

**Monocytosis**:
- Chronic infections, inflammatory conditions
- Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (neoplastic)

**Eosinophilia**:
- Parasitic infections, allergies, inflammatory states

**Basophilia**:
- Rare, may indicate myeloproliferative neoplasm

## Summary

### Complete Blood Count Components
The CBC is a comprehensive screening test providing:
- Red cell parameters (count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, RDW, MCH, MCHC)
- White cell parameters (count and differential)
- Platelet count

### Red Cell Evaluation
Three key parameters assess anemia/polycythemia:
- Hematocrit (volume of whole blood occupied by RBCs)
- RBC count (concentration of red cells)
- Hemoglobin concentration (oxygen-carrying capacity)

Use MCV to classify anemias (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic) and MCHC to assess hemoglobin content (hypochromic, normochromic).

### Poikilocytosis Recognition
Variations in red cell shape provide diagnostic clues:
- Membrane defects: spherocytes, elliptocytes
- Hemoglobin abnormalities: sickle cells, target cells
- Oxidative damage: bite cells, blister cells
- Mechanical damage: schistocytes
- Metabolic/environmental: acanthocytes, echinocytes

### White Cell Evaluation
The 5 main leukocytes are:
- Neutrophils (most abundant, bacterial defense)
- Lymphocytes (adaptive immunity)
- Monocytes (tissue macrophage precursors)
- Eosinophils (parasites and allergies)
- Basophils (hypersensitivity)

Use absolute counts to identify specific cytopenias or cytoses.

### Platelet Evaluation
- Normal: 150-400 × 10⁹/µL
- Thrombocytopenia: primary hemostasis defect
- Thrombocytosis: reactive (inflammation) or neoplastic

### The Rule of Three
For normal RBCs: RBC count × 3 ≈ Hgb ≈ Hct/3
Failure suggests abnormal MCH/MCHC.
