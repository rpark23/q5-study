## Learning Objectives

### 1. Describe the pathophysiology and clinical features of acquired aplastic anemia

**Pathophysiology:**
- Aplastic anemia is characterized by failure or destruction of hematopoietic stem cells
- Most cases are due to immune-induced marrow failure with activated T-cell-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells
- Mediated by interferon/TNF-induced apoptosis
- Direct injury of hematopoietic stem cells likely in some cases

**Epidemiology:**
- Less than 2 cases per million population per year in USA (2-3 times higher in Asia)
- Equal male-female incidence
- Most common form is acquired (peaks at ages 15-30 years and after 60 years)

**Associations:**
- Drugs (chloramphenicol)
- Chemicals (benzene)
- Radiation
- Infections (hepatitis non-A-G, considered autoimmune)
- Idiopathic (no association)

**Clinical Features:**
- Pallor due to anemia
- Bleeding (petechiae/bruises) due to thrombocytopenia
- Fever/bacterial infections due to neutropenia
- No hepatosplenomegaly
- No significant adenopathy
- No bone pain

**Laboratory Features (Severe Criteria):**
Peripheral blood findings (at least 2):
- Thrombocytopenia (<20,000/µl)
- Neutropenia (<500/µl)
- Anemia with reticulocytopenia (<20,000/µl)

Bone marrow: Hypocellular with fatty infiltration (dry tap)

**Treatment:**
- Supportive therapy: RBC transfusions, platelet transfusions, antibiotics as needed
- Restoration of hematopoiesis:
  - Bone marrow transplantation
  - Immunosuppressive therapy (ATG + cyclosporine: 70-80% response rate)
- Bone marrow transplantation survival rates (2026):
  - HLA-matched sibling: 90-95%
  - HLA-matched unrelated: 85-90%
  - Immunosuppressive therapy (no donor): 70-85%
  - HLA-haploidentical donor: 90+%

**Historical Context:**
- In 1975, treatment was only supportive with poor outcomes
- Discovery that ATG (anti-T cell therapy) could lead to recovery established immune-mediated mechanism
- Observation: marrow in recovered patients was that of recipient, not donor

### 2. Describe the pathophysiology and clinical features of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes

## A. Fanconi Anemia (FA)

**Pathophysiology:**
- DNA repair defect
- Multiple complementation groups identified (23 genes characterized)
- 60% due to FANCA mutations, 15% FANCC, 10% FANCG
- Part of FA/BRCA DNA damage repair pathway
- Defect in DNA repair leading to chromosomal instability

**Clinical Features:**
- Signs of bone marrow failure: pallor, bleeding, infections
- Onset at 3-10 years
- Congenital anomalies: skin hyperpigmentation, short stature, thumb abnormalities
- Autosomal recessive inheritance
- Heterozygote frequency: 1 in 300

**Laboratory Features:**
- Thrombocytopenia
- Neutropenia
- Anemia (usually macrocytic or normocytic) with reticulocytopenia
- Fetal RBC characteristics (increased Hgb F)
- Hypocellular bone marrow
- Diagnosis: Increased chromosomal breaks in lymphocytes stressed with alkylating agents (diepoxybutane)

**Clinical Course:**
- Progressive bone marrow failure within a few years
- Over 15% develop malignancies: myelodysplasia, acute leukemia, or other cancers (GU, head and neck)

**Management:**
- Androgens
- Matched-related donor BMT
- Matched-unrelated donor BMT
- Most FA patients now cured of bone marrow failure by HCT even without HLA-matched sibling
- Gene therapy (FANCA)
- Follow for development of oropharyngeal and gynecologic malignancies

## B. Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC)

**Pathophysiology:**
- DC is a telomere biology disorder (TBD)
- Due to mutations in telomerase genes leading to telomere loss/short telomeres
- Telomeres are protein-RNA complexes that stabilize chromosome ends and prevent shortening
- Telomeres maintained by telomerase enzyme complex
- Gene mutations: 30% DKC1 (X-linked), 15% TINF2 (AD), 10% TERC (AD), 10% TERT (AD/AR)

**Clinical Features:**
Variable presentation:
- Bone marrow failure (DC)
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Liver cirrhosis
- Premature grey hair
- Increased cancer risk

Classic triad:
- Dystrophic nails
- Reticular pigmentation of skin
- Oral leukoplakia

**Laboratory Features:**
- Very short telomeres in multiple cell lineages (granulocytes, lymphocytes, T-cells, B-cells)
- Telomere length below first percentile for age

**Clinical Course and Management:**
- Monitor for disease progression
- Median survival: 52 years
- Cause of death: 60-70% BMF complications, 10-15% severe pulmonary disease, 10% malignancies
- Androgens (transient response)
- Bone marrow transplant (response suboptimal due to underlying telomere defect)

## C. Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Autosomal recessive SBDS mutations (chromosome 7q)
- Ribosome biogenesis impaired
- Short telomeres in granulocytes

**Clinical Features:**
- Neutropenia + pancreatic malabsorption
- Short stature
- Skeletal abnormalities (metaphyseal dysostosis)
- May evolve into complete aplasia, MDS, or leukemia over years

**Management:**
- Hematologic: None or G-CSF
- RBC and platelets as needed in cases with aplasia
- Pancreatic enzyme replacement
- Fat-soluble vitamins
- Monitor for evolution of clonal abnormalities (20q- common and not concerning)
- BMT when indicated

## D. Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA)

**Pathophysiology:**
- 70% have mutations in ribosomal protein genes (RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A)
- Most common: RPS19 (25%)
- 20% have deletions of ribosomal protein genes
- All mutations occur in one allele (haploinsufficiency)
- Failure of normal ribosome formation leads to p53 activation and apoptosis of RBC precursors
- Block occurs between multipotential progenitor and committed erythroid precursor
- Erythroid failure characterized by accelerated apoptosis

**Clinical Features:**
- Pallor or symptoms related to anemia
- Onset before 1 year of age
- Family history (+/-)
- Physical abnormalities (30-50%):
  - Craniofacial: 40-50%
  - Short stature: 20-30%
  - Low birth weight: 10-25%
  - Thumb abnormalities: 10-15%
  - Congenital heart defects: 5-15%
  - Renal abnormalities: 3-20%

**Laboratory Features:**
- Anemia with reticulocytopenia
- Normal WBC and platelets (single lineage failure)
- Decreased erythroid precursors in bone marrow
- Fetal RBC characteristics:
  - Macrocytic RBC
  - Increased Hgb F
  - Increased erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity

**Therapy and Prognosis:**
- Steroids (60-80% response rate)
- RBC transfusions
- Iron chelation therapy
- Stem cell transplantation
- Long-term risks: leukemia and malignancies (osteosarcoma, colon cancer) but less than FA

### 3. Recognize the different clinical conditions associated with red cell aplasia

## A. Hypoplastic Anemia with Chronic Hemolysis

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Acute onset of pallor in children with chronic hemolytic anemia (sickle cell, hereditary spherocytosis)
- Aplastic crisis characterized by:
  - Hgb drop from 7-10 to 3-5 g/dl
  - Reticulocytes drop from 10-15% to 0-2%
  - Bilirubin drops from 1.5-3.0 to 0.5-2.0 mg/dl

**Pathophysiology:**
- Due to parvovirus B19 infection
- Parvovirus is cytotoxic for erythroid progenitor cells
- In normal individuals, no hemoglobin changes occur because immune response eradicates virus
- If RBCs have short life-span (hemolytic anemia), inability to make new cells rapidly produces severe anemia

**Diagnosis:**
- Parvovirus antigen detected in acute phase sera (PCR)
- Anti-parvovirus IgM and IgG detected after RBC hypoplastic episode

**Treatment:**
- RBC transfusions
- Beware: multiple cases can occur in families

## B. Hypoplastic Anemia with Immunodeficiency

**Clinical Features:**
- Normocytic anemia with low reticulocytes
- Seen with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency (HIV, immunosuppressive drugs following organ transplantation, leukemic chemotherapy)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Due to chronic parvovirus (B19) infection of erythroblasts
- Patients cannot mount effective immune response to clear virus

**Diagnosis:**
- B19 antigen detected by PCR

**Treatment:**
- IV gamma globulin (provides passive antibodies to clear virus)

---

## C. Adult Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)

**Associations:**
- Thymomas
- Hematologic malignancies (CLL, T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, 5q- myelodysplasia)
- Solid tumors (carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma)
- Immunologic disorders (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis)
- Infections (HIV, parvovirus, hepatitis)
- Drugs/chemicals (gold, halothane, valproate, phenobarbital, recombinant EPO)

**Pathophysiology:**
- Antibody-mediated inhibition of erythropoiesis (antibodies directed at erythroid progenitors or erythropoietin)
- In CLL and LGL leukemia: direct inhibition mediated by T-gamma lymphocytes
- In 5q- MDS: ribosomal protein gene mutation (RPS14) associated with p53 activation and apoptosis of RBC precursors

## Key Concepts Summary

**Bone Marrow Failure Classification:**
- Generalized bone marrow failure (pancytopenia) vs. single lineage failure (anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia)

**Historical Evolution:**
Bone marrow failure disorders have transformed from poorly understood conditions with limited therapeutic options and universally bad outcomes to a complex array of conditions with different molecular abnormalities and possibilities for new therapeutic options and better clinical outcomes.

**Molecular Mechanisms:**
1. DNA repair defects (Fanconi anemia)
2. Telomere biology disorders (Dyskeratosis congenita)
3. Ribosomal protein defects (Diamond Blackfan anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, 5q- MDS)
4. Immune-mediated destruction (Acquired aplastic anemia)
5. Viral-mediated (Parvovirus B19)

**Treatment Approaches:**
- Supportive care: transfusions, growth factors, antibiotics
- Immunosuppression: ATG, cyclosporine
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
- Gene therapy (emerging)
- Treatment of underlying condition (for secondary causes)

**Key Diagnostic Features:**
- Bone marrow biopsy showing hypocellularity
- Chromosomal breakage studies (Fanconi anemia)
- Telomere length analysis (Dyskeratosis congenita)
- Ribosomal protein gene mutations
- Elevated adenosine deaminase (Diamond Blackfan)
- Parvovirus testing in appropriate clinical settings
