**Lecture by:** Dr. May Chien, MD
**Course:** INDE-223B
**Date:** January 9, 2026

## Overview

This lecture covers hypoproliferative anemias, focusing on iron deficiency anemia, anemia of inflammation, and B12/folate deficiency. These conditions result from inadequate red blood cell production rather than increased destruction.

## Learning Objective 1: Iron Metabolism and Incorporation into Hemoglobin

### Iron's Critical Role
Iron is essential for oxygen transport through hemoglobin but also plays vital roles in:
- Mitochondrial electron transport
- DNA synthesis and replication
- Cellular metabolism
- Cell signaling

### Iron Distribution in the Body
Total body iron is 3-4 grams, distributed as:
- Red blood cells (hemoglobin): 1.8 g
- Liver (storage): 1.0 g
- RES macrophages: 0.6 g
- Bone marrow: 0.3 g
- Muscles (myoglobin): 0.3 g
- Transferrin (transport): 0.003 g

### Iron Absorption and Incorporation Pathway

**Step 1: Intestinal Absorption (Duodenum)**
- Dietary iron exists as heme iron and non-heme ferrous iron (Fe2+)
- Ferrous iron is imported into duodenal enterocytes via DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1)
- Low gastric pH and ascorbate enhance iron solubility and absorption
- Calcium can inhibit absorption

**Step 2: Export to Circulation**
- Iron exits enterocytes via ferroportin at the basolateral membrane
- Upon release, ferrous iron is oxidized to ferric form (Fe3+)
- Ferric iron is loaded onto transferrin for transport

**Step 3: Plasma Transport**
- Transferrin carries iron through the bloodstream (measured as TIBC - total iron binding capacity)
- Iron-laden transferrin (Fe2-Tf) binds to transferrin receptors (TfR) on cell surfaces

**Step 4: Cellular Uptake and Hemoglobin Incorporation**
- The transferrin-iron complex is endocytosed into cells
- Iron is either stored as ferritin or transported to mitochondria
- In mitochondria, iron is incorporated into protoporphyrin IX to form heme
- Heme combines with globin chains to form hemoglobin

### Iron Recycling
- Most functional iron comes from recycling, not dietary absorption
- 20-25 mg iron turnover daily for erythropoiesis
- Only 1-2 mg daily from dietary intake
- Senescent RBCs are phagocytosed by reticuloendothelial macrophages
- Iron is either stored as ferritin or exported via ferroportin back to plasma
- Each mL of RBCs contains approximately 1.0 mg of iron

## Learning Objective 2: Causes of Iron Deficiency

Iron deficiency arises from three main categories:

### Physiologic (Increased Demand)
- Infancy, rapid growth (adolescence), menstrual blood loss
- Pregnancy (second and third trimesters)
- Blood donation

### Environmental
- Insufficient dietary intake (rare in US adults except strict vegans)
- Poverty, malnutrition

### Pathologic

**Decreased Absorption:**
- Gastrectomy, duodenal bypass, bariatric surgery
- Helicobacter pylori infection
- Celiac disease, atrophic gastritis
- Inflammatory bowel disease

**Chronic Blood Loss:**
- GI tract: esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer, diverticulitis, benign tumors, malignant tumors
- GU system: heavy menses, menorrhagia, intravascular hemolysis
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
- Systemic bleeding disorders

**Drug-Related:**
- Glucocorticoids, salicylates, NSAIDs, proton-pump inhibitors

**Important Note:** In US adults, iron deficiency anemia is almost never from dietary insufficiency alone. Blood loss or malabsorption must be investigated.

## Learning Objective 3: Clinical and Laboratory Findings in Iron Deficiency Anemia

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms Related to Anemia:**
- Fatigue
- Shortness of breath
- Dyspnea on exertion
- Tachycardia (indicates significant, uncompensated anemia)

**Symptoms Specific to Iron Deficiency:**
- **Pica:** Craving for non-food substances (ice, clay, starch)
- **Tissue effects:**
  - Brittle, ridged nails
  - Koilonychia (concave, spooned nails)
  - Atrophic tongue
  - Angular stomatitis
  - Atrophic gastritis

### Laboratory Findings

**Complete Blood Count:**
- Low hemoglobin (anemia)
- Low MCV (microcytic)
- Elevated RDW (red cell distribution width - indicates variation in cell size)
- Low reticulocyte count (hypoproliferative)

**Peripheral Smear:**
- Microcytic, hypochromic red cells
- Abnormal shapes (pencil cells)

**Iron Studies:**
- **Serum iron:** Low
- **Transferrin (TIBC):** High (body attempts to maximize iron binding capacity)
- **Transferrin saturation (iron/TIBC):** Low
- **Ferritin:** Low (reflects depleted iron stores)

**Bone Marrow (rarely needed):**
- Poor hemoglobinization
- Absent stainable iron in macrophages

### Treatment Principles
- **IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING CAUSE** (most critical step)
- Replace iron deficit and replete iron stores
- Oral or intravenous iron supplementation
- RBC transfusions rarely needed unless patient is severely symptomatic

## Learning Objective 4: Role of Hepcidin in Anemia of Inflammation

### What is Anemia of Inflammation?
Also called anemia of chronic disease, this is a mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7-12 g/dL) that develops in the context of systemic inflammation.

### Conditions Associated with Anemia of Inflammation
- Inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease)
- Infection
- Malignancy
- Congestive heart failure
- Diabetes mellitus
- Chronic kidney disease
- Aging

### Mechanisms of Anemia

**1. Decreased Red Cell Survival**
- Inflammatory cytokines reduce RBC lifespan

**2. Decreased Red Cell Production**
- Bone marrow suppression
- Decreased erythropoietin response to anemia

**3. Functional Iron Deficiency (Key Mechanism)**
- Iron is sequestered despite adequate total body stores
- This appears to be an evolutionary defense mechanism against bacterial infections

### Hepcidin: The Master Regulator

**Hepcidin Production:**
- Produced by the liver in response to inflammation
- IL-6 is the primary cytokine that stimulates hepcidin production
- Other inflammatory mediators: TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ

**Hepcidin's Mechanism of Action:**
- Hepcidin binds to ferroportin (the iron exporter) on:
  - Duodenal enterocytes
  - Reticuloendothelial macrophages
- Binding causes ferroportin internalization and degradation
- This traps iron inside cells, preventing its release

**Consequences:**
- **Decreased iron absorption:** Iron cannot exit enterocytes into bloodstream
- **Increased iron sequestration:** Macrophages cannot release recycled iron
- **Low serum iron:** Less iron available in circulation
- **High ferritin:** Iron trapped in storage increases ferritin levels
- **Functional iron deficiency:** Adequate stores but unavailable for erythropoiesis

### Laboratory Findings in Anemia of Inflammation
- Mild to moderate anemia
- Normocytic to microcytic
- Low reticulocyte count
- Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP)
- **Low serum iron**
- **Low transferrin (TIBC)**
- **Elevated ferritin** (distinguishes from iron deficiency anemia)
- Normal to increased soluble transferrin receptor

### Comparison: Iron Deficiency vs Anemia of Inflammation

| Test | Iron Deficiency | Anemia of Inflammation |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Serum Iron | Reduced | Reduced |
| Transferrin (TIBC) | Increased | Reduced |
| Transferrin Saturation | Reduced | Reduced |
| Ferritin | Reduced | Normal to increased |
| Soluble Transferrin Receptor | Increased | Normal |

**Challenge:** Both conditions can coexist, making diagnosis difficult.

## Learning Objective 5: Causes of Macrocytic Anemia

Macrocytic anemias have MCV > 100 fL and can be classified as:

### Megaloblastic Causes
Characterized by impaired DNA synthesis leading to nuclear-cytoplasmic dyssynchrony:
- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**
- **Folate deficiency**
- Medications interfering with DNA synthesis (methotrexate, hydroxyurea)

### Non-Megaloblastic Causes
- Alcohol use
- Liver disease
- Hypothyroidism
- Myelodysplastic syndrome
- Reticulocytosis (young RBCs are larger)
- Medications (AZT, chemotherapy)

---

## Learning Objective 6: Biochemical Pathways of Folate and B12 Deficiency

### Overview of Megaloblastic Anemia
- Affects all rapidly dividing cells (bone marrow, GI tract)
- Impaired DNA synthesis slows nuclear maturation
- Cytoplasm matures normally
- Results in large cells with immature nuclei

### The Methionine Cycle and DNA Synthesis

**Folate's Role:**
- Dietary folate is converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF)
- THF is converted to methyl-THF (5-methyl tetrahydrofolate)
- Methyl-THF donates a methyl group in the methionine synthase reaction

**B12's Role:**
- Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a cofactor for methionine synthase
- Methionine synthase converts homocysteine to methionine using methyl-THF
- This reaction regenerates THF from methyl-THF

**Why This Matters:**
- THF is needed to produce thymidylate for DNA synthesis
- Without B12, methyl-THF accumulates but cannot be converted back to THF
- This creates a "folate trap" - folate is present but unusable
- DNA synthesis is impaired, affecting rapidly dividing cells

### The Methylmalonic Acid Pathway (B12 Only)

**B12's Second Role:**
- B12 (as adenosyl-B12) is a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
- This enzyme converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA
- Important for fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial function

**In B12 Deficiency:**
- Methylmalonyl-CoA accumulates and is converted to methylmalonic acid (MMA)
- Elevated MMA is specific to B12 deficiency
- May contribute to neurological complications

### Summary of Metabolic Consequences

**Both B12 and Folate Deficiency:**
- Impaired thymidylate synthesis → impaired DNA synthesis
- Elevated homocysteine levels

**B12 Deficiency Only:**
- Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA)
- Neurological complications due to impaired fatty acid metabolism and myelin synthesis

## Learning Objective 7: Dietary Sources and Absorption of B12 and Folate

### Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

**Dietary Sources:**
- Found ONLY in animal products (meat, fish, eggs, dairy)
- Made by bacteria found in foods of animal origin
- Vegans are at high risk for deficiency
- Body stores: 2-3 mg (3-4 years supply)

**Absorption Process:**

**Step 1: Stomach**
- Peptic digestion at low pH releases B12 from food proteins
- Parietal cells in gastric fundus and cardia produce intrinsic factor (IF)

**Step 2: Duodenum**
- Pancreatic proteases transfer B12 from other binding proteins to IF
- B12-IF complex forms

**Step 3: Terminal Ileum**
- Cubulin receptors on ileal enterocytes bind the IF-B12 complex
- Complex is transported into the enterocyte
- B12 is released and bound to transcobalamin for transport in blood

**Causes of B12 Deficiency:**

*Nutritional:*
- Strict veganism (no animal products)

*"IF Deficiency":*
- **Pernicious anemia** (autoimmune destruction of parietal cells)
- Gastrectomy

*Competition:*
- Fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum)
- Intestinal blind loop syndrome (bacterial overgrowth)

*Receptor Deficiency:*
- Ileal resection
- Crohn's disease
- Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (congenital cubulin deficiency)

*Other:*
- Transcobalamin II deficiency
- Nitrous oxide exposure
- Severe pancreatic disease

### Folate

**Dietary Sources:**
- Leafy vegetables (spinach, lettuce)
- Fruits
- Beans and legumes
- Also found in animal meats
- Many foods are fortified with folic acid in the US
- Body stores: 10-12 mg (3-week supply - depletes much faster than B12)

**Absorption:**
- Absorbed in duodenum and jejunum after deglutamylation
- Transported across brush border
- No special transport protein required (unlike B12)

**Causes of Folate Deficiency:**

*Nutritional:*
- Malnutrition
- Increased demand: pregnancy, hemolytic anemias, dialysis

*Malabsorption:*
- Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease)
- Tropical sprue
- Jejunal resection
- Severe Crohn's disease
- Short gut syndrome

*Medications:*
- Methotrexate (inhibits dihydrofolate reductase)
- Sulfasalazine
- Phenytoin
- Trimethoprim

*Other:*
- Alcohol (impairs absorption and metabolism)

## Learning Objective 8: Differences Between B12 and Folate Deficiency

### Clinical Features

**Similarities (Both Deficiencies):**
- Megaloblastic anemia
- Macrocytosis (often MCV > 110 fL)
- Pancytopenia (affecting all cell lines)
- Hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral smear
- Glossitis, GI symptoms

**Key Difference - Neurological Manifestations:**

**B12 Deficiency:**
- **Subacute combined degeneration** of spinal cord
  - Affects dorsal columns (position/vibration sense)
  - Affects lateral corticospinal tracts (weakness, spasticity)
- Paresthesias (numbness, tingling)
- Loss of position and vibration sense
- Ataxia
- Weakness and spasticity
- Memory loss and dementia
- **Can occur WITHOUT anemia** - treat based on B12 level even if Hgb normal

**Folate Deficiency:**
- **NO neurological manifestations**
- Neurologic symptoms should prompt investigation for B12 deficiency

### Laboratory Differentiation

| Test | B12 Deficiency | Folate Deficiency |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Serum B12 | Low | Normal to high |
| Serum folate | Normal to low | Low |
| RBC folate | Low | Low |
| Homocysteine | Elevated | Elevated |
| Methylmalonic acid (MMA) | Elevated | Normal |

**Key Distinction:**
- **Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is elevated ONLY in B12 deficiency**
- Both cause elevated homocysteine
- MMA is the most specific test for B12 deficiency

### Peripheral Smear Findings (Both)
- Macro-ovalocytes (large, oval red cells)
- Hypersegmented neutrophils (≥5 lobes) - hallmark finding
- Anisocytosis (variation in cell size)
- Poikilocytosis (variation in cell shape)

### Treatment Considerations

**B12 Deficiency:**
- Determine underlying cause (pernicious anemia, malabsorption, dietary)
- Intramuscular or oral B12 supplementation
- Lifelong treatment if due to pernicious anemia or surgical causes
- Monitor neurological symptoms - may be irreversible if longstanding

**Folate Deficiency:**
- Oral folic acid supplementation (1 mg daily)
- Address underlying cause
- **CRITICAL:** Always check B12 before treating with folate alone
- Folate can partially correct anemia but will worsen neurological damage if B12-deficient

**Warning:** Treating a B12-deficient patient with folate alone can mask the anemia while allowing neurological deterioration to progress.

## Additional Key Concepts

### Framework for Organizing Anemias

**By MCV:**
- Microcytic (MCV < 80): Iron deficiency, thalassemia, anemia of inflammation, lead poisoning, sideroblastic anemia
- Normocytic (MCV 80-100): Anemia of inflammation, early iron deficiency, renal disease, bone marrow failure
- Macrocytic (MCV > 100): B12/folate deficiency, alcohol, liver disease, hypothyroidism, MDS

**By Kinetics (Reticulocyte Count):**
- Hypoproliferative (low retic count): Inadequate production - iron deficiency, B12/folate deficiency, anemia of inflammation
- Hyperproliferative (high retic count): Increased destruction or loss - hemolysis, acute blood loss

### Reticulocyte Count Interpretation
- Reticulocytes are young RBCs that still contain RNA
- Normal: 0.5-2% of RBCs
- In anemia with appropriate marrow response: reticulocyte count increases (>2-3%)
- In hypoproliferative anemia: reticulocyte count is normal or low despite anemia
- Indicates marrow's inability to compensate for anemia

---

## Clinical Pearls

1. **Iron deficiency in adults is blood loss until proven otherwise** - always investigate the source

2. **Ferritin distinguishes iron deficiency from anemia of inflammation** - low in IDA, normal/high in AI

3. **Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeostasis** - blocks iron absorption and release in inflammation

4. **Neurological symptoms indicate B12 deficiency, not folate deficiency** - check B12 level if neurologic signs present

5. **MMA is specific for B12 deficiency** - both B12 and folate deficiency cause elevated homocysteine

6. **Never treat with folate alone without checking B12** - can worsen neurological damage

7. **Hypersegmented neutrophils are the hallmark of megaloblastic anemia** - look for ≥5 lobes

8. **Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease** - atrophy of gastric parietal cells, loss of intrinsic factor

9. **Iron is highly conserved** - most comes from RBC recycling (20-25 mg/day) not diet (1-2 mg/day)

10. **Anemia of inflammation is functional iron deficiency** - adequate stores but iron is sequestered and unavailable

---

## Summary

Hypoproliferative anemias result from inadequate RBC production due to:
- **Iron deficiency:** Most commonly from blood loss; characterized by microcytosis, low ferritin
- **Anemia of inflammation:** Hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration; low iron but elevated ferritin
- **B12/Folate deficiency:** Impaired DNA synthesis causing megaloblastic anemia; B12 deficiency uniquely causes neurological complications

Understanding the mechanisms of iron metabolism, hepcidin regulation, and folate/B12 biochemistry is essential for diagnosing and treating these common causes of anemia.
