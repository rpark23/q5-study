## Learning Objectives

### 1. Review Granulocytes and Monocytes
**Compare and contrast the morphology, cytoplasmic contents, and functions of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils**

#### Neutrophils
- **Morphology:** 12-15 μm with acidophilic cytoplasm containing small granules and multi-lobated nucleus (2-5 lobes)
- **Contents:**
  - Primary granules (MPO, lysozyme)
  - Specific granules (apolactoferrin, vitamin B12 binding protein, lysozyme, collagenase)
  - Tertiary granules (gelatinase, CD11b/CD18)
  - Secretory vesicles
- **Function:** Part of innate immune system; migrates to infection sites, phagocytizes organisms, and releases granules into phagosomes

#### Eosinophils
- **Morphology:** 8-10 μm with granules that strongly bind eosin and bilobed nuclei
- **Contents:** Crystalloid granules (cationic basic proteins), primary granules, small granules, lipid bodies, secretory vesicles
- **Function:** Major role in allergic inflammation and non-allergic inflammation (e.g., parasitic infections)

#### Basophils
- **Morphology:** 10-15 μm with basophilic cytoplasmic granules and multi-lobated nucleus (2-3 lobes)
- **Contents:** Granules containing histamine, heparin
- **Function:** IgE-stimulated secretion of inflammatory mediators including histamine, platelet-activating factor, and arachidonic acid metabolites

#### Monocytes
- **Morphology:** 10-15 μm with abundant cytoplasm and kidney-shaped folded nucleus
- **Contents:** Granules containing MPO, lysozyme, non-specific esterases
- **Function:** Heterogeneous cells involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation; recruited to tissues during inflammation and differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells

### 2. Neutrophil Function and Associated Functional Disorders
**Describe the normal function of neutrophils including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing/digestion of foreign materials**

#### Normal Neutrophil Function

**A. Circulation**
- Two pools of neutrophils exist in peripheral blood:
  - **Marginating pool:** Loosely associated with vessel endothelium (increased transit time in spleen, liver, bone marrow)
  - **Circulating pool:** Approximately 50% in each pool
- Neutrophils circulate with half-life of about 6 hours, then enter tissues and survive 2-3 more days

**B. Adherence**
1. Endothelial cells activated by stimulus
2. Neutrophils roll along vessel wall via SELECTINS
3. Neutrophils encounter chemoattractants that activate INTEGRINS on neutrophil surface
4. Integrins bind endothelial ligands (ICAM) forming tighter adhesion and stopping rolling
5. Neutrophils sense additional chemokines and migrate into tissue

**C. Chemotaxis**
- Migration of neutrophil within tissue toward target via chemoattractant gradients
- Mediated by β1 and β2 integrins
- Chemoattractant molecules include:
  - Bacterial formyl peptides (fMLP)
  - Lipids
  - Complement component C5a
  - Cytokines (IL-8)
  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF)

**D. Phagocytosis**
- Neutrophils recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on pathogen surface via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
- Opsonization enhances phagocytosis:
  - Immunoglobulins: Fc region binds Fc receptor on neutrophil
  - Complement (C3b)
- Pseudopod formation surrounds organism forming phagosome
- Phagosome fuses with granules releasing toxic chemicals

**E. Bactericidal Activity**

*Non-oxidative mechanisms:*
- Reduced pH (lactic acid from glycolysis)
- Cationic proteins
- Lactoferrin (chelates iron)
- Digestive hydrolases (lysozyme) break down bacterial cell walls
- Secretion: Granule release, cytokine release
- NETosis: Release of decondensed chromatin and granules onto pathogens

*Oxidative mechanisms (Respiratory Burst):*
- NADPH oxidase reduces O2 to superoxide (O2-)
- Superoxide dismutase converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
- Myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes oxidation of halide ions by H2O2 to microbicidal hypohalate ions

#### Functional Disorders of Neutrophils

**A. Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD)**
- **Etiology:** Autosomal recessive disorders affecting neutrophil adhesion to activated endothelium
  - Type I: CD18 (β2 integrin deficiency)
  - Type II: SLC35C1 (CD15s deficiency - selectin ligand)
  - Type III: FERMT3 (decreased integrin activation)
- **Clinical Features:**
  - Leukocytosis (elevated WBC due to decreased adhesion)
  - Recurrent bacterial infections
  - Non-healing ulcers
  - Delayed umbilical cord separation in infancy
  - Absence of pus at infection sites
- **Diagnosis:** CD11/18 flow cytometry on leukocytes
- **Treatment:** Can be lethal; stem cell transplantation is curative

**B. Chediak-Higashi Syndrome**
- **Etiology:** Rare autosomal recessive; mutations in CHS1/LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulatory proteins)
- **Pathophysiology:** Abnormal granule fusion in many granular cells (leukocytes, skin, hair, adrenal glands, CNS)
- **Clinical Features:**
  - Oculocutaneous albinism
  - Peripheral neuropathy
  - Severe pyogenic infections (Staphylococcus aureus)
  - Giant azurophilic granules in neutrophils
- **Neutrophil defects:**
  - Decreased chemotactic responsiveness
  - Defective degranulation
  - Delayed microbial killing
- **Treatment:** Ascorbic acid, G-CSF, prophylactic antibiotics; stem cell transplant is curative

**C. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**
- **Etiology:** Defect in respiratory burst due to absence/malfunction of NADPH oxidase; mutations in one of 5 genes (90% X-linked)
- **Clinical Features:**
  - Recurrent infections with catalase-positive bacteria (Staph, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Nocardia, Aspergillus)
  - Lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly with granulomas
- **Diagnosis:** Flow cytometric detection of dihydrorhodamine (DHR) conversion (classically NBT dye)
- **Treatment:** CSFs, stem cell transplant

**D. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Deficiency**
- **Etiology:** Most common inherited disorder of phagocytes; autosomal recessive
- **Pathophysiology:** Quantitative defect (defective post-translational processing of MPO polypeptide); compensation via alternate antimicrobial pathways
- **Clinical Features:**
  - Increased infection susceptibility in only 20% of patients
  - Disseminated fungal infections in patients with diabetes

### 3. Introduction to Neutropenia
**Describe disorders of granulocytes, including functional and quantitative disorders; describe causes, clinical features, and treatment principles of neutropenia**

#### Definition and Classification
- **Neutropenia:** Decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
  - ANC = WBC × (%segs + %bands)
  - In most patients: ANC < 1.5 × 10^9/L (1,500)
- **Severity:**
  - Severe: <500
  - Moderate: 500-1,000
  - Mild: 1,000-1,500
- **Clinical Significance:** Increased risk of severe bacterial infection, particularly with ANC <500

#### Approach to Neutropenia
**History:**
- Timing (acute vs. chronic)
- Context (neonatal, recent drugs, background disease)
- Symptoms (fevers, ulcers/abscesses, frequency/pattern)

**Physical Exam:**
- Evidence of infection
- Lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly
- Congenital abnormalities

**Laboratory:**
- Trend CBCs
- Other counts affected?

#### Causes of Neutropenia

**A. Acquired (Secondary) Neutropenia**

*Infectious:*
- Viral: Varicella, measles, rubella, hepatitis A and B, EBV, CMV, influenza, parvovirus
- Sepsis: Consumption of marrow reserve

*Drug-Induced (most common cause of agranulocytosis):*
- Chemotherapy drugs (alkylating agents)
- Antibiotics (penicillin)
- Anticonvulsants (valproic acid, carbamazepine)
- Anti-inflammatory drugs
- Antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine)
- Diuretics

*Immune-Mediated:*
- Systemic/autoimmune disease
- LGL/Felty Syndrome
- Autoimmune neutropenia

*Hematopoietic Neoplasm:*
- Myelodysplasia, acute leukemia

**B. Congenital Neutropenias**

**Normal neutrophil count for Duffy-negative phenotype:**
- Linked to SNPs in DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokine)
- Homozygosity results in Duffy null Fy(a-b-) phenotype
- Common in people from Sub-Saharan Africa (80-100%) and Arabian peninsula (50-70%)
- NOT associated with increased risk of infection

**Severe Congenital Neutropenia (ELA-2 mutations):**
- Autosomal dominant
- Neutrophil elastase mutations trigger unfolded protein response and apoptosis
- Severe neutropenia (ANC <500, often <200)
- Recurrent bacterial infections presenting in early infancy
- May have increased risk (2-8%) for myelodysplasia or leukemia transformation
- **Treatment:** G-CSF, stem cell transplant

**Kostmann Syndrome (HAX-1 mutations):**
- Autosomal recessive
- HAX-1 (HS1-associated protein) mutations affect mitochondrial protein function
- Induces apoptosis in hematopoietic stem cells
- Severe infections; often fatal before age 2 years
- **Treatment:** Usually not responsive to G-CSF; requires stem cell transplant

**Cyclic Neutropenia (ELA-2 mutations):**
- Autosomal dominant
- Severe neutropenia (ANC <500) every 21 days
- Nadirs last 3-5 days with symptoms: fatigue, mouth sores, gingivitis
- **Diagnosis:** CBC 2-3 times per week; mutation analysis (95% ELA-2 mutations)
- **Treatment:** G-CSF if needed
- No increased risk of leukemia or MDS

#### Treatment Principles
**Acute neutropenia:**
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Consider G-CSF for seriously ill patients

**Chronic neutropenia:**
- G-CSF indicated for ANC <0.5 × 10^9/L with recurrent infections
- Start at low doses and adjust based on response
- Regular CBC monitoring

## Key Disorders Discussed

### Functional Disorders
1. Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency
2. Chediak-Higashi Syndrome
3. Chronic Granulomatous Disease

## Clinical Pearls

1. **MPO, lysozyme, and CD11b/CD18** are important markers in neutrophil function and immunophenotyping of leukemias

2. **Left-shift** refers to the release of immature neutrophils (bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes) into circulation during high demand

3. **Duffy-negative phenotype** is a normal variant (not true neutropenia) common in people of African and Arabian descent

4. **Neutropenia severity** correlates with infection risk:
   - ANC <500: Severe risk
   - Death can occur within hours to days without treatment

5. **Leukemoid reaction** mimics leukemia but is a reactive process with WBC >50,000/μL

6. **Catalase-positive organisms** (Staph, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Nocardia, Aspergillus) are characteristic infections in CGD

7. **Giant azurophilic granules** are pathognomonic for Chediak-Higashi syndrome

8. **Delayed umbilical cord separation** (normal: 2-4 weeks) suggests leukocyte adhesion deficiency
