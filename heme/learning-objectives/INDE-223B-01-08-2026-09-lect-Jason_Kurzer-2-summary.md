## 1. Lymphopoiesis and B-cell Development

### Overview of Lymphocyte Development
- **Lymphocytes** are key components of the adaptive immune response
- Lifespan varies from days to years
- B-cells and T-cells responsible for specific pathogen targeting and long-term immunity
- Develop from common lymphoid progenitor (CLP)

### B-cell Development Stages

#### Bone Marrow (Antigen-Independent Phase)
- **Location:** B-cells develop in the bone marrow (remember: B = Bone marrow)
- **Key processes:**
  - Heavy chain rearrangement occurs first
  - Functional heavy chain combines with surrogate light chain (pre-B cell stage)
  - Light chain rearrangement follows
  - Immature B-cells exit marrow expressing IgM

#### Marker Expression During B-cell Maturation
- **Early B-cell precursors:** Express CD10 and CD34
- **As maturation progresses:**
  - First lose CD34
  - Eventually lose CD10
- **Clinical pearl:** CD34 expression suggests immaturity and may indicate acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia

#### Secondary Lymphoid Organs (Antigen-Dependent Phase)
- **Naive B-cells circulate** (15-30% of circulating lymphocytes) to:
  - Lymph nodes
  - Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
  - Spleen
- Upon antigen encounter, differentiate into memory B-cells or plasma cells

## 2. Histology of the Lymph Node

### Architecture and Blood Flow
- **Lymphatic inflow:** Antigens enter through subcapsular sinus
- **Arterial inflow:** Naive B-cells enter at high endothelial venules
- **Venous outflow:** Memory B-cells and plasmablasts exit

### Compartments

#### Follicles (B-cell Rich)
- **Primary follicles:** No germinal center
- **Secondary follicles:** Contain germinal center
  - **Germinal center:** Site of somatic hypermutation and class switching
  - **Mantle zone:** Surrounds germinal center, composed of naive B-cells
  - **Marginal zone:** Peripheral zone (prominent in spleen)

#### Paracortex (T-cell Rich)
- Surrounds follicles
- Contains high endothelial venules
- Site where lymphocytes enter lymph node

### The Germinal Center: Key Functions

#### Purpose
Specialized immune zone that increases B-cell antigen recognition through:

1. **Somatic hypermutation** of immunoglobulin genes to increase affinity
   - Most mutations result in nonfunctional immunoglobulin → apoptosis
   - Functional high-affinity mutations → proliferation (every 6-8 hours)

2. **Heavy chain class switching:** IgM → IgG, IgA, or IgE

3. **Selection process:**
   - Positive selection: B-cells with high affinity proliferate
   - Negative selection: Non-functional mutations induce apoptosis
   - Duration: 3-4 weeks after antigen exposure

#### Germinal Center Structure

**Dark zone:**
- Densely packed large cells (centroblasts)
- Highly proliferative
- Site of somatic hypermutation

**Light zone:**
- Less densely packed small cells (centrocytes)
- Less proliferative
- Site of selection

**Tingible body macrophages:**
- Scattered throughout germinal center
- Consume apoptotic B-cells

#### Key Cellular Components

**B-cells (CD20+):**
- Localized to follicles
- Re-express CD10 in germinal center
- Lack BCL2 expression in germinal center (allows negative selection)

**T-cells (CD3+):**
- Concentrated in paracortex
- Follicular helper T-cells present within follicles
- Antigen-specific, assist with follicle center reaction

**Follicular dendritic cells (CD21+):**
- Form scaffolding of germinal center
- Attract B-cells to follicle
- Present antigens to germinal center B-cells

### Post-Germinal Center B-cells

#### Memory B-cells
- Long-lived response
- Express high-affinity IgG, IgA, or IgE on surface
- Slowly or never divide
- Provide rapid response upon re-exposure to antigen

#### Plasma Cells
- Secrete high-affinity immunoglobulins
- Migrate to bone marrow (secrete into circulation)
- Or migrate to mucosal tissue (secrete IgA)

## 3. Histology of the Thymus and T-cell Development

### Overview
- **Location:** Anterior mediastinum
- **Function:** Site of T-lymphocyte maturation
- **Growth pattern:** Grows until puberty (20-50g), then undergoes involution (5-15g in adults)

### Structure

#### Cortex
- Densely packed with immature T-cells (thymocytes)
- Site of:
  - T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement
  - Expression of CD4 and CD8 (double positive stage)
  - Positive selection for MHC binding
  - Negative selection against self-antigen binding

#### Medulla
- Less densely packed
- Contains Hassall corpuscles (whorls of epithelial cells)
- Site of final maturation
- Thymocytes become either CD4+ or CD8+ (single positive)
- Mature naive T-cells exit to circulation

### T-cell Development Process

1. **Entry:** Precursor T-cells from marrow enter thymic cortex
2. **TCR rearrangement** and acquisition of CD4/CD8
3. **Positive selection:** Must bind MHC molecules
4. **Negative selection:** Must NOT bind self-antigen
5. **Commitment:** Develop into CD4+ (MHC-II binding) or CD8+ (MHC-I binding)
6. **Exit:** Mature naive T-cells express CD3 and return to circulation

### Thymic Involution
- Thymic tissue progressively replaced by adipose tissue with age
- Thymus can still produce some new T-cells throughout life

## 4. Histology of the Spleen

### Functions

#### Red Pulp (Filtering Spleen)
- Filters aged erythrocytes
- Removes foreign substances
- Stores blood cells (approximately 1/3 of platelets)

#### White Pulp (Immune Spleen)
- Fights infection
- Provides defense against blood-borne pathogens
- Composed of B-cells, T-cells, and macrophages

### Red Pulp Architecture

#### Splenic Cords
- **Open circulation** system
- Reticular tissue lined by macrophages
- Slows erythrocyte flow while allowing plasma to pass
- Hypoxic, hypoglycemic, acidic environment toxic to aged red cells
- Macrophages phagocytose aged erythrocytes (cull) or "bite off" membrane inclusions (pit)

#### Sinuses
- **Structure:** Lined by littoral cells (phagocytic endothelial cells) lacking tight junctions
- **Function:** Return blood cells to venous circulation
- **Selection mechanism:** Red cells must squeeze through approximately 3 μm pores
- Abnormal red cells may not fit through and get phagocytosed

### White Pulp Architecture

#### Organization
- Tracks arterioles and capillaries
- **Central artery:** Arterial supply through white pulp

#### Periarteriolar Lymphoid Sheath (PALS)
- **Composition:** T-cell rich zone
- **Location:** Surrounds central artery
- **Function:** T-cells interact with dendritic cells and B-cells

#### Follicles
- **Composition:** B-cell rich
- **Structure:** Similar to lymph node follicles
  - Germinal center (when reactive)
  - Mantle zone
  - Marginal zone (unique to spleen)

#### Marginal Zone
- **Location:** At intersection of red pulp and white pulp
- **Composition:** B-cell rich
- **Function:** Site where antigen-presenting cells enter white pulp
- Allows slow blood flow for increased macrophage contact
- Important for defense against encapsulated organisms (especially in children)

### Splenic Circulation: Immune Function
- Antigen enters white pulp via blood (not lymph as in lymph nodes)
- Macrophages present antigen to B-cells and T-cells
- Activated lymphocytes can exit through marginal zone and red pulp

## 5. Disorders of the Spleen

### Splenomegaly (Enlargement of Spleen)

#### Causes

**Hypertrophy from immune response:**
- Infectious mononucleosis

**Hypertrophy from red blood cell destruction:**
- Hemolytic anemias (autoimmune, hereditary spherocytosis, etc.)

**Congestive (venous outflow obstruction):**
- Cirrhosis/portal hypertension

**Lysosomal storage diseases:**
- Gaucher disease
- Niemann-Pick disease

**Neoplastic:**
- Lymphoma
- Myeloproliferative neoplasms

#### Hypersplenism
- **Definition:** Enlargement of spleen with increased phagocytosis
- **Clinical features:**
  - Cytopenias (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
  - Thrombocytopenia most common (platelet sequestration)
  - Hyperplastic bone marrow (compensatory)
  - Splenomegaly
- **Treatment:** Splenectomy can correct cytopenias

### Histologic Findings in Splenic Disorders

#### Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
- Expansion of red and white pulp
- Prominent germinal centers (secondary follicles)
- Histiocytosis of splenic cords (macrophages consuming platelets)
- Splenectomy follows exhaustion of pharmacologic options

#### Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
- Expanded red pulp filled with erythrocytes
- Hemosiderin deposition (red cell breakdown product)
- Compressed sinuses
- Depleted white pulp (if on immunosuppressive therapy)

#### Hereditary Spherocytosis
- Massive congestion of splenic cords
- Abnormal erythrocytes trapped due to lack of deformability
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis may be present

#### Extramedullary Hematopoiesis
- Occurs during marrow stress
- Megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors in red pulp
- Seen in primary myelofibrosis and other marrow disorders

### Hyposplenism (Underactivity of Spleen)

#### Causes
- Surgical removal
- Congenital asplenism
- Autoimmune conditions
- Infections
- Infarction (e.g., repeated infarcts in sickle cell disease)

#### Clinical Significance
- Increased susceptibility to infections (especially encapsulated bacteria)
- May require vaccinations (pneumococcal, meningococcal, H. influenzae)
- May require prophylactic antibiotics

## Clinical Pearls

1. **CD34+ B-cells:** Suggest acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia
2. **BCL2+ germinal centers:** May indicate follicular lymphoma
3. **Asplenia/hyposplenism:** Requires vaccination against encapsulated organisms
4. **Splenomegaly:** Most commonly causes thrombocytopenia (platelet sequestration)
5. **Germinal center polarization:** Normal finding (dark zone vs. light zone)
6. **Thymus in adults:** Small but still functional; can see follicular hyperplasia
7. **Sickle cell disease:** Repeated splenic infarcts lead to autosplenectomy
