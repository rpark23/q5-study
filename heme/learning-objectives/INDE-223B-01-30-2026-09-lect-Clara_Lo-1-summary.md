## Basic Platelet Physiology

### Platelet Anatomy and Function

**Structure**:
- Smallest circulating hematopoietic cells
- Anucleate but contain mitochondria and granules
- Dense granules and alpha granules responsible for platelet activation
- Cell surface receptors: GPIb-IX-V (binds von Willebrand Factor), GP-IIb-IIIa (binds fibrinogen and other platelets)

**Function in Primary Hemostasis**:
- Maintain vascular integrity by sealing damaged endothelium
- Initiate endothelial repair process
- Process involves:
  1. Platelet adhesion: Activated platelets bind to exposed VWF via GPIb-IX-V receptor
  2. Platelet aggregation: Additional platelets accumulate by binding to other platelets and fibrin via GP-IIb-IIIa
  3. Formation of platelet-fibrin plug with clot retraction

**Platelet Activation**:
- Calcium influx causes actin filament elongation
- Activated platelet spreads out, attaches to clot, and contracts
- Release of granule contents promotes further activation

### Megakaryocytes and Platelet Production

**Megakaryocyte Characteristics**:
- Largest hematopoietic precursor cell (5-20 times size of red cell)
- Polyploid with multi-lobed nucleus
- Mean ploidy of 16N (can reach 64N)
- One megakaryocyte produces thousands of platelets
- Located primarily in bone marrow (also in lungs)
- Never seen in peripheral circulation
- Maturation takes 5 days

**Megakaryocytopoiesis Process**:
- First compartment: MK progenitor cells amplify
- Second compartment: Cessation of proliferation, formation of pseudopods and platelet organelles
- Cytoplasmic division produces 2,000-4,000 platelet fragments
- Platelets released into circulation via pseudopods extending into vascular sinuses

### Growth Factors and Regulation

**Colony Stimulating Factors** (early differentiation):
- c-kit ligand (stem cell factor)
- Interleukin-3, IL-6, IL-11
- GM-CSF

**Thrombopoietin (TPO)** (major regulator):
- 70kd molecule, 332 amino acids, encoded on chromosome 3q
- Constitutive production in liver and kidney
- Binds to c-MPL receptor on CD34 cells, megakaryocytes, and erythroid progenitors
- TPO binding causes receptor dimerization and activation of JAK2 signaling pathway

**Feedback Mechanism**:
- Fixed amount of circulating TPO produced
- Total platelet mass binds circulating TPO
- Thrombocytopenia results in decreased TPO binding and increased free TPO
- Increased free TPO stimulates increased platelet production
- Creates negative feedback loop

**Clinical Significance**:
- Interleukins upregulated in inflammatory conditions explain reactive thrombocytosis
- JAK2 mutations can cause myeloproliferative neoplasms (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis)
- Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia (CAMT) results from lack of functioning TPO receptor

### Platelet Distribution and Survival

**Normal Platelet Count**: 150,000-450,000 per microliter (average 250,000)

**Distribution**:
- 2/3 circulating in peripheral blood
- 1/6 loosely adherent to splenic sinusoids
- 1/6 in non-splenic platelet pool at various sites

**Characteristics**:
- Lifespan: 7-10 days
- Limited bone marrow reserve leads to rapid development of thrombocytopenia if production fails
- Young (newly formed) platelets are larger
- Platelets lose glycosylated surfaces in spleen if not activated or involved in clot formation

**Developmental Timeline**:
- First seen in circulation at 5-6 weeks post-conception
- Platelet count greater than 150,000 by second trimester in healthy fetus
- Term and preterm infants should have same platelet count as adults (no "physiologic" thrombocytopenia)

## Approach to Patient with Thrombocytopenia

### Is Thrombocytopenia Isolated or Associated with Other Abnormalities?

**With Other Cytopenias**:
- Anemia or abnormal white blood cell counts: Consider leukemia, aplastic anemia
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Consider Evans Syndrome

**Isolated Thrombocytopenia**:
- More defined differential diagnosis
- Focus on platelet-specific disorders

### History

**Patient Demographics**: Age, ethnicity, sex

**Constitutional Symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, early satiety, bone pain

**Concomitant Illnesses**

**Drug History**: Prescription and illicit drugs (sulfa medications, aspirin, NSAIDs)

**HIV Risk Factors**

**Family History**: Consanguinity (may suggest congenital bone marrow failure disorders like Fanconi Anemia)

**Bleeding History**:
- "Wet" bleeding: Mucocutaneous bleeding, menorrhagia, epistaxis, tooth extractions, surgery, trauma
- Petechiae in dependent areas and pressure points
- Males: Bleeding with circumcision
- Females: Menorrhagia
- CNS bleeding can occur but joint and deep muscle bleeds relatively unusual (unlike hemophilia)

### Physical Examination

**Signs of Hemorrhage**:
- Skin: Petechiae, purpura, bruising
- Nasal or oral bleeding: Gum line bleeding, oral purpura ("blood blisters"), petechiae on palates
- Fundi
- Pressure points: Bra straps, waistbands, backpack straps, socks

**Adenopathy**: Consider infections or neoplastic processes (especially leukemia)

**Organomegaly**:
- Hepatomegaly/splenomegaly: Consider consumption/sequestration, leukemia, infections (malaria, EBV)
- Splenomegaly can cause mild-moderate thrombocytopenia (typically 50-100,000)

**Other Physical Anomalies**:
- Short stature, abnormal digits/thumbs, cleft lip/palate (TAR syndrome, Fanconi Anemia)
- Hyper/hypopigmentation: Cafe au lait lesions, ash leaf spots (Fanconi Anemia)

**Special Considerations**:
- Decide if bleeding is spontaneous, secondary to trauma, or normal
- Many children have normal bruising on shins
- Linear or loop pattern bruising concerning for non-accidental trauma

### Laboratory Tests

**Essential Tests**:
- CBC with differential
- Peripheral blood smear review (WBC, RBC, and platelet morphology)
- Chemistry panel: LDH, uric acid, K+, phosphorus

**Coagulation Studies** (if unusual bleeding or unknown platelet count):
- INR, PT, PTT
- Platelet function (PFA-100)
- Platelet aggregometry
- Von Willebrand screen

**Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia Workup**:
- ANA, C3, C4
- Free T4, TSH
- Antiphospholipid panel
- Direct Coombs test
- Quantitative immunoglobulins

**Infectious Workup**: HIV, hepatitis serologies

**Genetic Testing**: Congenital thrombocytopenia genetic sequencing

**Bone Marrow Examination**:
- Rarely indicated immediately in isolated thrombocytopenia
- Consider in bicytopenia, pancytopenia, or concerning histories/physical findings

### Platelet Function Testing

**Platelet Function Assay (PFA-100)**:
- Analyzes platelet function in citrated whole blood
- High shear rates through aperture coated with collagen and epinephrine or ADP
- Measures time to aperture closure
- Prolonged PFA suggests problem with platelet adhesion, activation, or aggregation

**Platelet Aggregometry**:
- Measures platelet response to various agonists using light transmission
- Normal tracings show aggregation to epinephrine, ADP, collagen, ristocetin, and arachidonic acid
- Useful for suspected congenital platelet defects

### Platelet Transfusion Response

**Diagnostic Value**:
- Post-transfusion platelet count (typically at 1 hour)
- Significant rise suggests production problem
- Poor rise or lack of persistence suggests destruction/sequestration

**Management Value**:
- For bleeding episodes
- Pre-procedural support

### Peripheral Smear Findings

**Young Platelets**:
- Larger size with increased mean platelet volume (MPV)
- Seen in immune thrombocytopenia and other destructive processes

**Giant Platelets**:
- Larger than surrounding red cells
- Can indicate young platelets or macrothrombocytopenia syndromes (MYH-9, Bernard-Soulier)

**Schistocytes**:
- Fragmented red blood cells
- Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
- Seen in TTP, HUS, DIC

## Common Causes of Thrombocytopenia

### General Categories

**Thrombocytopenia is more common than thrombocytosis**

**Platelet counts represent balance of production and destruction**

**Two General Categories**:
1. Decreased production
2. Increased destruction/sequestration

### Decreased Production

**Congenital Thrombocytopenia Syndromes**:
- CAMT (Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia): Lack of functioning TPO receptor
- TAR syndrome (Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius): Bilateral absence of radii, thrombocytopenia resolves by school age
- Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome: Immunodeficiency, small platelets, X-linked
- Bernard-Soulier: Macrothrombocytopenia, defect in GPIb

**Infiltration of Bone Marrow**:
- Leukemia
- Other malignancies

**Aplastic Anemia**:
- Fanconi Anemia: Chromosome breakage repair defect, increased risk of malignancy, associated physical features (cafe au lait, short stature, cardiac/renal anomalies, hearing deficits, skeletal abnormalities)

**Drugs**: Sulfa derivatives, thiazides

**Infection**: Viral suppression (CMV, Toxoplasma in neonates)

**Idiopathic**

### Increased Destruction

**Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)**:

*Pathophysiology*:
- Increased platelet production but not sufficient to compensate for short platelet lifespan (hours)
- Immunoglobulin attachment to platelets with subsequent splenic macrophage destruction
- Antigen ill-defined (can involve GPIIbIIIa but also other antibodies)
- Often follows viral infection due to molecular mimicry

*Clinical Features*:
- Symptoms: Bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding
- Hematuria and GI bleeding less common
- Intracerebral hemorrhage rare (less than 1 percent)
- In children: Usually follows viral infection, often spontaneously resolves in months
- In adults: Often chronic disease

*Diagnosis*:
- Clinical diagnosis
- Isolated thrombocytopenia with large platelets
- Anti-platelet antibodies have low specificity and sensitivity

*Acute Management*:
- Immune modulators:
  - Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): Efficacy onset 24-48 hours
  - Anti-RhD (WinRho): Black-box warning for profound hemolysis and renal failure
  - Corticosteroids: Efficacy onset 5-7 days
  - All are temporizing measures with effects waning after 2-4 weeks
- Thrombopoietin-mimetics: Stimulate platelet production
- Observation alone reasonable if no bleeding
- Avoid NSAIDs, aspirin, omega-3

*Chronic ITP Management* (lasting greater than 12 months):
- Observation
- Rituximab (anti-CD20): 30 percent 5-year event-free survival
- Splenectomy: 70 percent 5-year event-free survival
- TPO mimetics (chronic therapy):
  - Romiplostim (subcutaneous)
  - Eltrombopag (oral)
  - Side effects: Thrombocytosis, rebound thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, GI upset

**Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia**

**Thrombocytopenia Associated with Autoimmune Diseases**

**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**

**Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)**:

*Pathophysiology*:
- Lack of ADAMTS13 (Factor VIII metalloprotease that cleaves extra-large VWF multimers)
- Acquired: Low ADAMTS13 with positive inhibitor (antibody-mediated clearance)
- Congenital (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome): Low ADAMTS13 without inhibitor (inherited mutations resulting in 5-10 percent normal levels)
- Widespread platelet aggregation in small vessels of kidney and brain
- Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia from fibrin strand shearing of red cells

*Clinical Features*:
- More common in adults (except Upshaw-Schulman presents in infancy/early childhood)
- Preceding viral infection, pregnancy, drug use
- Autoimmune disorders (SLE)
- Fever, pallor, jaundice, petechiae
- Neurologic and renal manifestations
- Renal failure

*Diagnosis*:
- ADAMTS13 levels
- Peripheral smear showing schistocytes/microangiopathy

*Treatment*:
- Plasmapheresis/fresh frozen plasma
- Recombinant ADAMTS13 (recently FDA-approved for congenital TTP)

### Sequestration

**Hypersplenism**:
- Cirrhosis
- Infiltrative diseases of spleen (malignancies, Gaucher disease)
- Typically results in mild-moderate thrombocytopenia (50-100,000)

### Hereditary Thrombocytopenias

**Glanzmann Thrombasthenia**:
- Defect in GPIIb/IIIa receptor
- Platelet aggregation defect
- Normal platelet counts commonly
- Diagnosis: Aggregometry shows absent aggregation to all agonists except ristocetin, flow cytometry confirms GPIIb/IIIa deficiency
- Management: Observation, platelet transfusion (HLA-matched to avoid alloimmunization), antifibrinolytics, recombinant Factor VII

**Bernard-Soulier Syndrome**:
- Defect in GPIb receptor
- Large platelets (macrothrombocytopenia)
- Platelet adhesion defect
- Mild degree of thrombocytopenia
- Diagnosis: Aggregometry shows normal response to all agonists except ristocetin, flow cytometry confirms GPIb deficiency
- Management: Observation, platelet transfusion (HLA-matched), antifibrinolytics

**MYH9 Disorders**:
- Macrothrombocytopenia
- Associated with hearing loss and renal insufficiency

**Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome**:
- Immunodeficiency
- Small platelets
- X-linked inheritance

**TAR (Thrombocytopenia Absent Radii)**:
- Unilateral or bilateral absence of radius
- Thrombocytopenia ranges from severe to mild
- Typically resolves by school age
- Skeletal abnormalities persist

**Gray Platelet Syndrome**:
- Deficiency of alpha granules
- Platelets appear "ghost-like" on peripheral smear

## Key Concepts

### Primary Hemostasis
- Platelets are integral to primary hemostasis
- Qualitative and quantitative platelet disorders cause mucocutaneous bleeding
- Joint and muscle bleeds much less common (more typical of secondary hemostasis disorders)

### Platelet Production
- Megakaryocytes are largest hematopoietic cells
- Production tightly regulated by thrombopoietin
- Limited bone marrow reserve
- Rapid development of thrombocytopenia possible

### Clinical Assessment
- Comprehensive history and physical examination essential
- Peripheral smear review very informative
- Distinguish production versus destruction
- Isolated versus associated cytopenias guides differential

### Management Principles
- Treatment depends on underlying etiology
- Observation appropriate for asymptomatic patients
- Platelet transfusions for severe bleeding or pre-procedural
- Immune modulators for ITP (temporizing measures)
- Plasmapheresis/FFP for TTP
- Genetic counseling for hereditary disorders
