## Learning Objectives

### 1) Understand the incidence and pathophysiology of AML and MDS

#### **AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)**

**Definition:**
- A clonal proliferation of precursor cells with reduced capacity to differentiate into mature cells
- Defined by >20% blasts in bone marrow/blood OR presence of characteristic chromosomal abnormalities [t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17)] OR myeloid sarcoma/extramedullary leukemia
- Results in bone marrow failure with decreased production of red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells

**Epidemiology:**
- Approximately 25,000 new cases in the U.S. annually
- Median age of presentation: ~70 years
- Most common acute leukemia in adults (children almost always have ALL)
- Incidence increases dramatically with age

**Historical Context:**
- First described by Peter Cullen (1811): patient with "milky white" serum
- Term "leukämie" coined by Rudolf Virchow (1847), father of cell theory

**Pathophysiology:**
- Arises from myeloid lineage in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation
- Malignant cells proliferate and crowd out normal hematopoiesis
- Leads to pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)

---

#### **MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndromes)**

**Definition:**
- Acquired stem cell disorder resulting in bone marrow failure
- Characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with morphologic dysplasia
- Previously called "pre-leukemia"
- Low blood counts despite typically hypercellular marrows
- Overall ~30% risk of progression to AML

**Pathophysiology:**
- Acquired mutations result in ineffective hematopoiesis
- Abnormal-appearing cells in bone marrow
- Manifests primarily as anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia

**Evolution to AML:**
The progression follows: Micro CHIP → CHIP → CCUS → Lower Risk MDS → Higher Risk MDS → Secondary AML
- CHIP = Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential
- CCUS = Clonal Cytopenia of Undetermined Significance

### 2) Describe the risk factors and clinical manifestations of AML and MDS

#### **Risk Factors**

**Genetic Fragility:**
- Fanconi anemia
- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
- Down, Klinefelter, Bloom, Patau syndromes

**DNA Damage:**
- Benzene exposure
- Prior radiation therapy
- Prior chemotherapy (topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents)

**Antecedent Hematologic Disorders:**
- Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
- Myeloproliferative disorders (CML, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis)

**Clinical Pearl:** Prior chemotherapy/radiation and pre-existing bone marrow malignancies are major risk factors for AML development.

---

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

**Symptoms:**
- **Fever/chills** - from neutropenia or paraneoplastic effects
- **Weakness/fatigue/dyspnea** - from anemia
- **Bleeding/bruising/floaters** - from thrombocytopenia
- **Bone pain** - from expansion of medullary cavity
- **Headaches** - from CNS infiltration
- **Early satiety/abdominal distension** - from splenomegaly

**Signs:**

*Common:*
- Pallor
- Ecchymoses/petechiae

*Less Common:*
- Gingival hyperplasia (M4/M5 subtypes)
- Splenomegaly (M4/M5/ALL)
- Leukemia cutis
- Myeloid sarcoma
- Numb chin syndrome
- DIC (M3 - acute promyelocytic leukemia)
- Hypoxia/myocardial infarct/stroke

**Clinical Pearl:** Older patients with acute leukemia are much more likely to present with pancytopenia than with leukocytosis.

---

### 3) Discuss the genomic features and prognosis of AML and MDS

#### **AML Classification**

**Historical (FAB Classification):**
- M0: Undifferentiated
- M1: Myeloblastic
- M2: Myeloblastic, differentiated
- M3: Promyelocytic
- M4: Myelomonocytic
- M5: Monocytic
- M6: Erythrocytic
- M7: Megakaryocytic

**Current (WHO Classification):**
Based on recurrent genetic abnormalities and molecular features including:
- Chromosomal translocations: t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), 11q23 (MLL), t(9;11), t(6;9), Inv(3)/t(3;3), t(1;22)
- Mutations: NPM1, CEBPa
- Myelodysplasia-related changes
- Differentiation state

**Pro Tip:** AML is increasingly characterized by its molecular underpinnings rather than just morphology.

---

#### **Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) - M3**

**Special Features:**
- Approximately 10% of new AML diagnoses (600-800 cases/year in U.S.)
- t(15;17) translocation resulting in PML-RARα fusion protein
- Blocks retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation
- Commonly presents with coagulopathy/DIC, CNS hemorrhage
- Previously the most rapidly fatal form of AML

**Treatment Breakthrough:**
- Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (+/- chemo)
- Now one of the most curable acute leukemias (3-year OS >80-90%)

**Pro Tip:** Understanding the genetic basis of APL has led to major advances in its treatment and curability.

---

#### **AML Risk Stratification**

Based on cytogenetic and mutational analysis:

| **Good Risk (25%)** | **Intermediate Risk (60%)** | **Poor Risk (15%)** |
|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| t(15;17) | Normal karyotype | Δ11q23 |
| t(8;21) | FLT3 mutation | t(6;9) |
| inv(16), t(16;16) | +8 | Complex karyotype |
| NPM1 mutation | 1-2 clonal abnormalities | inv(3) |
| CEBPa mutation | Other | -7, 7q-, -5, 5q- |

**Prognosis:**
- Survival varies dramatically based on risk category
- Low risk: Better outcomes, potentially curable with chemotherapy alone
- High risk: Poor outcomes, often requires transplant

---

#### **MDS Classification and Prognosis**

**WHO 2022 Classification:**
- MDS post-cytotoxic therapy
- MDS with defining genetic abnormalities (5q deletion, SF3B1 mutation, multi-hit TP53)
- MDS defined by morphology (low blasts, increased blasts, hypoplastic)

**Prognosis (Revised International Prognostic Scoring System - R-IPSS):**
- Based on: bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype/cytogenetics, number of cytopenias
- New 2023: M-IPSS incorporates genetic mutations
- Median survival ranges from ~9 years (R-IPSS low risk) to <1 year (R-IPSS very high risk)

**Bonus:** The R-IPSS was developed by Stanford's Peter Greenberg!

### 4) Define the general modalities of therapy for AML and MDS

#### **LEUKEMIA EMERGENCIES: Leukostasis**

**Clinical Pearl:** Propensity for leukostasis depends on size/stickiness of leukemic cells:
- AML: >50-100K
- ALL: >100-150K
- CML: >200-250K
- CLL: >400-500K

**Symptoms/Signs:**
- Pulmonary: dyspnea, hypoxia
- Cardiac: chest pain, myocardial infarction
- CNS: headaches, confusion, vision changes, cranial nerve palsies
- GU: priapism
- Fever in ~80%
- **20-40% 7-day mortality**

**Treatment:**
- **Chemotherapy as soon as possible**
- Until then:
  - Leukapheresis (immediate but short-lived cytoreduction, requires dialysis catheter)
  - Hydroxyurea (takes 24-48 hours to work)
  - **Avoid PRBC transfusion** unless symptomatic anemia (increases serum viscosity)

---

#### **AML Treatment - "Fit" Patients**

**Treatment Strategy Based on Risk:**
- **Low risk** → Chemotherapy alone
- **Standard risk** → Chemotherapy alone vs. chemotherapy then allogeneic stem cell transplant
- **High risk** → Chemotherapy then allogeneic stem cell transplant

**Pro Tip:** Genetics are the major determinant of risk category. Low-risk patients can potentially be cured with chemotherapy alone (without transplant).

---

**Induction Chemotherapy:**
- **Goal:** Complete remission (CR) = 3-log reduction in leukemic cell burden
- **Most common regimen:** "7+3" +/- another drug
  - Cytarabine (Ara-C) × 7 days
  - Anthracycline × 3 days
- "Ctrl-Alt-Delete" of bone marrow
- 3-4 week hospital stay for marrow recovery
  - Manage anemia/thrombocytopenia (PRBCs, platelets)
  - Manage neutropenia (antibiotics, G-CSF)
  - Manage mucositis (parenteral nutrition, PCA)

**Consolidation Chemotherapy:**
- Usually high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC)
- Can be with curative intent (low risk, 3-4 cycles)
- Can be temporizing until transplant

---

#### **AML Treatment - "Unfit" Patients**

**Low Intensity Therapy:**
- **Goal:** Palliative/life-prolonging
- Focus on quality/length of life
- Initial goal: complete remission, then "maintenance" as long as possible

**Standard Options:**
- Hypomethylating agents (decitabine/azacitidine) + BCL2 inhibitor (venetoclax)
- Targeted drugs alone or with hypomethylating agents:
  - FLT3 inhibitors
  - IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors

---

#### **Recent FDA Approvals in AML (2017-2025)**

From 1970s to 2017, there was essentially ONE approval:
- 2000: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (removed from market in 2010)
- Called the "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"

**Since 2017, 15 new approvals:**
- 04/28/17: Midostaurin (FLT3 inhibitor)
- 08/01/17: Enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor)
- 08/03/17: Liposomal 7+3 (CPX-351)
- 09/01/17: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (re-approved)
- 07/20/18: Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor)
- 11/21/18: Venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor)
- 11/21/18: Glasdegib (Hedgehog pathway inhibitor)
- 11/28/18: Gilteritinib (FLT3 inhibitor)
- 06/01/20: Oral azacitidine (maintenance)
- 05/25/22: Ivosidenib + azacitidine
- 12/02/22: Olutasidenib (IDH1 inhibitor)
- 07/20/23: Quizartinib (FLT3 inhibitor)
- 11/15/24: Revumenib (Menin inhibitor)
- 11/13/25: Ziftomenib (Menin inhibitor)

---

#### **MDS Treatment**

**Lower-Risk MDS:**
- Hematopoietic growth factors:
  - Erythropoietin (red blood cells)
  - G-CSF (white blood cells)
- Transfusions
- Prophylactic antibiotics
- Iron chelators (if iron overloaded)
- Lenalidomide (for 5q- syndrome)
- Luspatercept (for low-risk MDS with SF3B1)

**Pro Tip:** Low-risk MDS is treated with supportive measures like growth factors and transfusion support PRN.

---

**Higher-Risk MDS:**
- Hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine)
- AML-like chemotherapy
- Bone marrow/stem cell transplant

**Pro Tip:** High-risk MDS has a very poor prognosis, is likely to transform to AML, and is treated with various chemotherapies.

---

#### **MDS Morbidity**
- Transfusion dependence/iron overload
- Infection
- Bleeding
- Transformation to AML

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **AML is often a medical EMERGENCY** at initial presentation, particularly with leukostasis

2. **Both AML and MDS are life-threatening hematologic malignancies** leading to bone marrow failure (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)

3. **With aggressive, high-intensity therapy, 30-50% of patients can be CURED**

4. **Genetics determine prognosis and treatment approach** - cytogenetic and molecular analysis is essential

5. **Lots of recent advances in AML/MDS treatment** - 15 new FDA approvals since 2017 after decades of stagnation

6. **AML affects the myeloid lineage** - which produces erythrocytes, megakaryocytes/platelets, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and macrophages (making it "the most important hematologic malignancy")
