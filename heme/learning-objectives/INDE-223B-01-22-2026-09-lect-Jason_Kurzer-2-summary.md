**Department:** Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine
**Date:** January 22, 2026

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Common Causes of Generalized Lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy can result from several categories of conditions:

- **Infectious causes** - The most common cause of lymph node enlargement
- **Neoplasia**
  - Metastatic cancer
  - **Lymphoma** - Important to recognize as part of the differential
- **Medications** - Drug-induced lymphadenopathy
- **Immune-mediated (non-infectious)**
  - Autoimmune conditions
- **Endocrine disorders**

### 2. Predisposing Factors for Developing Lymphoma

Risk factors include:

- **Increased age** - Risk rises with advancing age
- **Male > Female** - Males have higher incidence
- **Developed countries** - Higher rates in industrialized nations
- **Immunodeficiency** - Major risk factor
- **Infectious agents**
  - Viral: HIV, EBV, HTLV, HHV8, Hepatitis C
  - Bacterial: H. pylori (associated with gastric MALT lymphoma)
- **Autoimmunity** - Chronic immune stimulation
- **Family history** - Genetic predisposition
- **Environmental exposures**
  - Chemicals
  - Drugs
  - Radiation

**Special note on HIV:** HIV-associated lymphomas represent a multifactorial process involving immunodeficiency, which predisposes to lymphomas often involving EBV-infected clonal B-cells. Common HIV-associated lymphomas include DLBCL, primary CNS lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and primary effusion lymphoma.

### 3. Hodgkin Lymphoma: Background Features and Reed-Sternberg Cells

**Definition:** Neoplasm derived from germinal center B-cells characterized by neoplastic Hodgkin or Reed-Sternberg cells embedded in a reactive inflammatory background.

**Key Pathologic Features:**

- **Background:** Mixed inflammatory cells (reactive, not neoplastic) with fibrous tissue
- **Low fraction of tumor cells** - The Reed-Sternberg cells are rare
- **Reed-Sternberg cells:**
  - Large neoplastic giant cells with bi-lobed or multi-lobed nuclei
  - Prominent nucleoli ("owl's eye" appearance)
  - Derived from germinal center B-cells
  - Express CD30 and CD15
  - Usually negative for most B-cell markers (e.g., CD20), but weakly PAX5 positive
  - Sometimes EBV positive
  - Lack CD45 (common leukocyte antigen)

**Pathogenesis:** Involves impaired B-cell program and deregulation of apoptosis, JAK/STAT signaling, and NF-kB pathway.

### 4. Clinical Features and Hematologic Findings of Hodgkin Lymphoma

**Clinical Presentation:**

- **Lymphadenopathy** - Usually cervical or supraclavicular nodes
- **Mediastinal mass** - Common presentation
- **B symptoms** (present in many patients):
  - Fever >100.4°F
  - Drenching night sweats
  - Weight loss ≥10% in 6 months

**Epidemiology:**

- 10% of lymphomas in the U.S.
- ~8,500 new cases per year; 1,050 deaths per year
- **Bimodal age distribution:** 15-35 years old and >50 years old

**Adverse Hematologic Findings:**

- Anemia
- Lymphopenia
- Leukocytosis

### 5. Staging Work-up and Ann Arbor (Lugano) Staging Classification

**Staging System:** Ann Arbor staging (modified as Lugano staging for NHL)

| Stage | Definition | "E" Criteria |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| I | 1 node region | Single site, no nodes |
| II | 2+ nodes, 1 side of diaphragm | I or II + contiguous extranodal |
| II*bulky | II + bulky disease | N/A |
| III | Nodes both sides of diaphragm OR nodes above + spleen below | N/A |
| IV | III + additional non-contiguous extranodal | N/A |

**Additional Classifications:**

- **A:** No systemic symptoms
- **B:** Fever (>100.4°F), night sweats (drenching), weight loss (≥10% in 6 months)
- **E:** Extension from nodal site

### 6. Complications of Hodgkin Lymphoma Therapy (ABVD)

**ABVD Regimen:** Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine

**Short-term Toxicities:**

- Neutropenia
- Alopecia (hair loss)

**Long-term Toxicities:**

- **Anthracycline (Adriamycin):** Cardiac dysfunction
- **Bleomycin:** Pulmonary toxicity

**Secondary Malignancies (from chemotherapy + radiation):**

- Colorectal cancer
- Breast cancer
- Lung cancer (presumably radiation-related)
- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

**Current Treatment Approach:** Emphasis on minimizing radiation to reduce long-term complications. Overall cure rate is 80-90%.

### 7. Comparison of Follicular Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

#### Follicular Lymphoma (FL)

**Natural History & Clinical Features:**

- **Indolent lymphoma** of germinal center B-cells
- Most common indolent lymphoma (60% of low-grade lymphomas)
- 25% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas
- Usually presents with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy
- 25% experience B symptoms
- Usually systemic at diagnosis (Stage III or IV)
- Bone marrow involvement in 30-60%

**Pathology:**

- Effaced lymph node architecture
- Poorly defined, closely packed follicles
- Diminished mantle zones
- Lack of polarization (no distinct light/dark zones)
- Lack of tingible-body macrophages
- BCL2 protein aberrantly expressed within follicles
- Cells express CD20 (B-cells), CD10 (germinal center origin)
- Express light chain restriction (kappa or lambda, not both)

**Treatment:**

- Stage I/II: Radiation, immunotherapy (anti-CD20, rituximab), ± chemotherapy
- Stage III/IV: Watch and wait if asymptomatic, or chemotherapy (Bendamustine + rituximab or R-CHOP)
- **Relapsing course** - tends to recur
- **Incurable** - goal is symptom management

**Outcomes:**

- Median survival ~20 years
- Response to chemotherapy at 24 months helps predict survival
- May transform to more aggressive lymphoma (e.g., DLBCL)
- Prognosis assessed by Follicular Lymphoma International Prognosis Index (FLIPI)

#### Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)

**Natural History & Clinical Features:**

- **Aggressive lymphoma** - heterogeneous group
- Most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Western countries (~30%)
- Increases with age
- Rapidly growing mass with local symptoms
- B symptoms in ~30%
- 60% present with systemic disease (Stage III or IV)
- Bone marrow involvement in 30%
- May present extranodally (e.g., GI tract)

**Pathology:**

- Effaced architecture
- Lack of follicles (diffuse pattern)
- Sheets of large atypical lymphoid cells
- Nuclei size of macrophages with prominent nucleoli
- Express CD20 (B-cells)
- May express CD10 (germinal center origin)
- 30% have t(14;18) translocation (especially if transformed from FL)
- "Double hit" lymphomas: BCL2 + MYC translocations (worse prognosis)
- Two main subtypes:
  - Germinal Center B-cell like (GCBL) - better prognosis
  - Activated B-cell like (ABL) - worse prognosis

**Treatment:**

- Typically upfront chemotherapy (R-CHOP or R-pola-CHP)
- Restaging followed by additional therapy or biopsy as needed
- Relapsed/refractory disease may receive transplant or alternate therapy

**Outcomes:**

- **Fatal if untreated**
- **~50-60% are cured** - potentially curable due to susceptibility to chemotherapy
- International Prognostic Index (IPI) assesses prognosis based on:
  - Age >60 years (worse)
  - Elevated LDH (worse)
  - Stage III/IV (worse)
  - >1 extranodal site (worse)
  - ECOG performance status

### 8. Pathogenesis of NHL: Cytogenetic Alterations

**BCL-2 and t(14;18) Translocation:**

- Common in **Follicular Lymphoma** (~90%)
- BCL2 gene (chromosome 18) translocates next to immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter (chromosome 14)
- Results in **overexpression of BCL2**, an anti-apoptotic protein
- Normally BCL2 is downregulated in germinal centers to allow negative selection
- Aberrant expression prevents apoptosis, allowing cells to survive and accumulate additional mutations
- Can be detected by:
  - Immunohistochemistry (BCL2 protein in germinal centers)
  - FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization)
  - PCR (polymerase chain reaction)

**MYC and t(8;14) Translocation:**

- Characteristic of **Burkitt Lymphoma**
- MYC gene (chromosome 8) translocates to immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (chromosome 14)
- Results in **dysregulated proliferation**
- Near 100% mitotic rate in Burkitt lymphoma
- Creates highly aggressive lymphoma

**Double Hit Lymphomas:**

- Have both BCL2 and MYC translocations
- Subset of DLBCL with particularly poor prognosis
- Considered high-grade B-cell lymphomas

**Common Chromosome 14 Translocations in B-cell Lymphomas:**

- t(14;18): Follicular lymphoma (BCL2)
- t(11;14): Mantle cell lymphoma (Cyclin D1)
- t(8;14): Burkitt lymphoma (MYC)

### 9. Comparison of B-cell and T-cell Lymphomas

#### B-Cell Lymphomas

- **85% of lymphomas**
- Precursor B-cell neoplasms present as acute leukemia in children
- Mature B-cell lymphomas occur mostly in adults
- Exception: Burkitt lymphoma common in children
- Wide variety of subtypes with distinct features
- Can be diagnosed with:
  - Immunohistochemistry (CD20, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, etc.)
  - Flow cytometry (light chain restriction)
  - FISH for characteristic translocations
  - Molecular studies (IGH rearrangement, mutations)

#### T-Cell Lymphomas

- **10-15% of lymphomas**
- Precursor T-cell neoplasms present as mediastinal mass in children and young adults
- Mature T-cell lymphomas occur in adults
- Exception: ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma also in children
- Generally have worse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas
- Specific types have distinct features:
  - **Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma:** Associated with HTLV-1 virus
  - **Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma:** Associated with EBV, highly aggressive
  - **ALK+ Anaplastic large cell lymphoma:** t(2;5) translocation, better prognosis than other T-cell lymphomas
- Diagnosed with:
  - T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement studies
  - Immunohistochemistry for T-cell markers
  - Flow cytometry

## Key Concepts

### General Lymphoma Features

**Definition:** Tumors of B, T, and NK cells of the immune system that:

- Arise in lymphoid organs
- May secondarily involve bone marrow ("lymphoma/leukemia")
- Range from indolent to highly aggressive
- Require ancillary studies for diagnosis (flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, molecular testing)

**Epidemiology:**

- Incidence has risen from ~11 per 100,000 (1975) to ~21 per 100,000 today
- ~25,000 deaths per year from lymphoma in the U.S.

### Lymphoma vs. Leukemia

Both are leukocyte malignancies, but the distinction has evolved:

**Classic distinction:**

- Lymphoma = involves lymph nodes, spleen
- Leukemia = malignant white cells in blood and bone marrow

**Modern understanding:**

- Classification now based on cell markers, translocations, and mutations
- Many lymphomas can have a "leukemic phase" with marrow/blood involvement
- The tissue vs. blood distinction is less diagnostically important
- Note: This concept applies to lymphoid malignancies; myeloid leukemias are distinct

### Classification and Nomenclature

**Broad Categories:**

1. **Hodgkin Lymphoma** - Distinct category with unique biology
2. **Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma**
   - B-cell lymphomas (85%)
   - T-cell lymphomas (10-15%)

**Integrated Diagnostic Approach requires:**

- Morphology (histology)
- Immunophenotype (markers)
- Genetic features (translocations, mutations)
- Clinical features (presentation, staging)

### B-Cell Development and Lymphomagenesis

Lymphomas often resemble specific stages of normal B-cell development:

- **Precursor B-cell:** B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia
- **Pre-germinal center:** CLL/SLL, Mantle cell lymphoma
- **Germinal center:** Follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, some DLBCL, Hodgkin lymphoma
- **Post-germinal center:** Marginal zone lymphomas, some DLBCL
- **Plasma cell:** Plasma cell myeloma

**Marker Expression Changes During Development:**

- Early: TdT+, CD10+, CD79a+, PAX5+
- Mature B-cell: CD5+, CD10+, CD20+, sIgM+
- Germinal center: CD20+, sIgM+, sIgD+, CD10+, BCL6+
- Post-germinal center/Memory: CD10-, CD20+, BCL6+
- Plasma cell: CD138+, cIgG/A+

### Burkitt Lymphoma

**Three Clinical Variants:**

1. **Endemic** (Equatorial Africa, Papua New Guinea)
   - Children 3-7 years old
   - Jaw/facial bone/orbit involvement
   - Nearly 100% EBV positive
   - 50x higher incidence than U.S.

2. **Sporadic** (Western countries)
   - Rare, bimodal age (0-15; >60)
   - Abdominal presentation (ileum/cecum, kidney, testis/ovary)
   - <30% EBV positive

3. **Immunodeficiency-associated**
   - HIV patients
   - Lymph nodes, bone marrow, CNS involvement
   - 25-40% EBV positive

**Pathologic Features:**

- Extremely rapid growth
- "Starry sky" pattern (tingible body macrophages among sheets of tumor cells)
- Intermediate-sized cells with vacuolated cytoplasm
- Near 100% proliferation rate
- Express CD20, CD10 (germinal center origin)
- t(8;14) translocation with MYC upregulation

**Treatment:** Dose-intensive chemotherapy with 5-year survival: 60-90% (young adults), 50% (adults), 30% (elderly)

### Staging and Prognosis

**Lugano Staging** (modified Ann Arbor):

- Incorporates PET/CT imaging
- Accounts for bulky disease
- Includes "E" criteria for extranodal extension
- B symptoms indicate more aggressive disease

**Treatment Approaches:**

- Watch and wait (indolent lymphomas)
- Antibiotics (H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma)
- Reduced immunosuppression (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders)
- Radiation ± chemotherapy (Hodgkin lymphoma)
- Multi-agent chemotherapy (aggressive lymphomas)
- Immunotherapy (anti-CD20 rituximab, CAR-T therapy)
- Bone marrow transplant (refractory disease)

## Summary

Malignant lymphomas represent a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms with varying clinical presentations, pathologic features, and outcomes. Understanding the causes of lymphadenopathy, predisposing factors for lymphoma, and the key features of major lymphoma subtypes is essential for diagnosis and management. Hodgkin lymphoma, characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells in a reactive background, has an excellent prognosis with modern therapy. Among non-Hodgkin lymphomas, follicular lymphoma is indolent but incurable, while DLBCL is aggressive but potentially curable. Cytogenetic alterations involving BCL2 and MYC play critical roles in lymphomagenesis, and understanding B-cell versus T-cell lymphomas helps guide diagnosis and treatment approaches. Modern lymphoma management integrates clinical, pathologic, and molecular features to optimize patient outcomes.
